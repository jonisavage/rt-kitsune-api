</p><p>So, is there even anything I can do? Or is it all done and I should just down-grade till a power fault doesn't lose me information that it perfectly had in check? (given the recovery files are being updated, even after the crash FF surely had the latest versions of those to work from)

I closed Firefox before I wanted to shut down the PC (Windows 10 with April 2018 update) and get a Firefox crash notification. As per usual, I click restore and all my tabs came up! Closed Firefox again - no notifications.
This morning, when I opened Firefox, I got 3 tabs - Google Mail sign in, Facebook sign in and an empty tab.
I read up on the issue everywhere (using Chrome!!) and then Mozilla support. I was directed to 2 posts. The one did not apply to me and the other one was so technically demanding that a person with average computer knowledge simply could not follow that to and fro.
So now, how do I get my tabs back?  I had gone to sessionstore-backups and only found 2 entries: see attached image, both are from today, Not yesterday!
I am stumped

1216922,1525867892,Websites become unresponsive but can still be scrolled through and the hand cursor appears all the time,"<p>In the past weeks, suddenly my Firefox started behaving really weird - a few times a day the currently opened tab becomes unresponsive (you can't click or hover anything) but you can still scroll through them (at least a bit - after that point, it's just plain white). At these times, the cursor is the hand one, during the whole unresponsiveness episode, as if everything was clickable (though obviously clicking does nothing). You also can't close the tab during this tab - the only way is either to wait a good 30 seconds for it to unfreeze or to change to a different tab and close the unresponsive one. When you do change tabs, though, the newly opened tab sometimes disappears completely, with a radial loading circle appearing in the middle of the screen for a few seconds before it magically reappears (it does _not_ reload, though!). From what I've been able to observe, this tends to appear on content-heavy websites like Reddit, Facebook and YouTube most often.
</p><p>What is happening? I haven't changed my browsing habits in the past weeks, nor have I installed any new add-ons. I've tried disabling the ones I have but it's still happening with them turned off. What else may I try?

Unfortunately, with firefox 60, this advice no longer works. The best I can get is just top sites only, but the icons for this only show the top site's icon rather than a screenshot of the page. These are much too small, leaving loads of blank page around them (and adding more top sites would make the new tab page much too busy); and the icons &amp; titles chosen aren't very useful (e.g., the icon for the google maps page is just the google logo with the title ""google"", this isn't very informative).
</p><p>To paraphrase:
</p><p>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.aboutHome.enabled = False
</p><p>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled = False

</p><p>Is it possible to change back, without giving up and just installing the ESR firefox? I like the lower ram usage of quantum, but the UI is a deal breaker.

Beginning version 60 this is no more possible, requiring either complete manual install, or starting a complete Gnome/KDE session for root just to allow Firefox to update (sorta clumsy...).
If it is absolutely necessary to refuse starting under sudo, wouldn't it be possible to provide something like update-only mode of the browser which would allow running as root under sudo?

The laptop in question is a Clevo P641HK1 barebone, with an i7-7700HQ processor, Intel HD630 graphics, Nvidia 1050Ti graphics, 16GB of DDR4 Ram and a Samsung 960 Pro NVMe SSD.
</p><p>The issue I am having is that, quite often, using Firefox would cause my screen to flash black multiple times a second, thereby making my notebook unusable. It also often shortly blacks the screen when minimizing Firefox. I've tried using safe mode as well as changing the hardware acceleration settings, but it made no difference. As it stands I am convinced that this is somehow related to Firefox using my Intel GPU in a certain way that would trigger this behavior.

Later, I saw two porn sites that he insisted he did not link to.  I received a subscription confirmation this morning and blocked it.  Now, I would like to unblock it so that I can discover if this grandson filled in his personal information, proof positive that he lied to me.  By the way, he is 13. TRUTH is not a part of his vocabulary and hasn't been since I first came to know him after my daughter adopted him.  My biggest issue is that he lied (if he did).  I understand teen boys' fascination with sex and the female body, but he will have to find his visual sources elsewhere.

1217323,1526066617,"Lost tabs after update, previous.jsonlz4 and upgrade.jsonlz4 not found","<p>Earlier today firefox updated (to 60.0 I believe) and there were no issues, all my tabs were safe and I just had to log in again to a few sites, but when I later closed firefox and reopened it a few minutes later I found my last sessions tabs were gone even though I've always had them saved between session (I even checked options and it was still enabled). The 'restore last session' tab is unavaible since there was no crash of any kind and 'closed tabs' was clean too.
I've now spent a few hours looking through the forum for fixes and tried just about everything.
As many posts direct you to, I've checked the 'sessionstore-backups' folder in my profile folder to get the .json files, however there's ONLY the recovery.baklz4 and recovery.jsonlz4 files present, even with hidden files and folders turned on. So i'm missing the previous.js and upgrade.js.
I found one other user (post here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214114)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214114)</a> who had this issue as well and found the missing files with ShadowExplorer, but in my case the old sessionstore folder found through ShadowExplorer still had only the very recent recovery.bak and recovery.json. I also tried the other program linked in the thread, but it requires system restore points, which I don't have enabled.
I even checked all the .bak and .json files I could find with <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html</a> for htmls, but there's only the tabs from the session after I lost all the old ones.
My old session probably had 200+ tabs from from the past few months, some were a bit important or job-hunting related (the most relevant ones were bookmarked, luckily).

Well my concern  is because with Google Chrome (I know that is offensive to compare) I have open more than 30 tabs and its ram consumption is understanble to be higher, nevertheless is really close to mozilla ( Lets say 1GB of RAM). I tried to run mozilla on safe mode with no addons but I get the same result. I tried reduce the content process limit to 2 (4 by default) but again, the RAM consumption still high. I reinstall mozilla, but unfortunately nothing changes. Im the only one with this trouble? Any ideas of what it can be?
The mozilla version what Im using is 60 x64 and windows 10 x64

</p><p>Popped out a new window in the background when I highlighted some text.
</p><p>1. Every time JavaScript is used to pop-up a new tab or window, an icon should be made available to report the site for unwanted pop-ups. The site could be added to a blacklist. The blacklist should be downloaded in whole rather than queried on Firefox servers for privacy (Mozilla does care about privacy doesn't it?).
</p><p>2. If a site is on the blacklist and it tries to pop-up a tab/window then the popup could be blocked and same icon could highlight for say 10 seconds. Clicking the icon in this case would give the options to open the popup, white-list the page for the user, vote against the blacklist. Something like:
</p><p>[  ] Show the blocked page.
[  ] White-list this site for me.
[  ] I don't think this site should be blacklisted
</p><p>[ OK ]    [Cancel]
</p><p>Some fuzzy logic could perhaps be used to determine whether or not to keep sites on the blacklist. Sites with very large amounts of blacklisting+white-listing could be manually looked at.
</p><p>Also: 
I don't ever want anything happening when I highlight text other than the text being high-lighted, it's not necessary and it completely ruins the browsing experience. No excuses, it's bad. Add a white-list if necessary for the 0.01% edge cases where this might be useful.

A whole bunch of sites said that it was a virus of some description, probably a tracking and adware virus, though those seemed to be sites wanting you to pay for their products too. 
</p><p>One of these sources did suggest that it was a 'potentially unwanted program', so I scanned my computer with malwarebytes and quarantined the two potentially unwanted programs it suggested, which were both in the mozilla folder of Appdata/Roaming but when opening it up again and testing it by googling something, it was trackid=sp-006 appended to it. Here is an example:
</p><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=fs&amp;trackid=sp-006"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=fs&amp;trackid=sp-006</a>

I do have ghostery installed, so will that help at all in not being tracked by malicious sources in cases like this? also, I have avast and httpseverywhere installed too.

1: is Trackid=sp-006 a virus or a tracker?

Although it is possible to turn them off, for some reason Mozilla removed the option to enter the user's preferred URL to open. The recommended solution to this, as I read in some threads, is to install an add on. Why do I need to install an add on to restore a functionality you removed? And, why did you remove it anyway? What harm can a user inflict by being greeted with a familiar page when opening a new tab.
</p><p>I will repeat the request I have read several times, in more polite words: Please bring back this feature that many users seem to miss. Forcing the user to open an unfamiliar page in a new tab does not make much sense from user experience design perspective and providing this option causes no harm to Firefox.

Currently, the caption only shows the title for the focus-tab in each window.
(b) Have each window automatically save the tabs that are open in that window whenever I close that window. This would enable us to close one window and save the tabs for it, without closing all other windows. 
(c) Allow me to select from named unopened windows in the context menu of FF on the task bar, which would then open that particular window with all its previously saved tabs. This would allow me to open only the named windows I want. Currently, it's open all windows or nothing.

1217420,1526144143,Why is Firefox returning only ONE PAGE of search results? I want exhaustive results. Advanced Search option is useless for addressing this.,"<p>I'm a retired PhD with multiple in depth interests, and I use the web as a resource daily, to look for practical information as well as for news and music, etc. 
</p><p>Firefox has been my preferred browser for over a decade because of its versatility and - before now - its user friendliness for both low- and high-information content Web users. I've become reliant on Ixquick as other search engines have been relentlessly dumbed down in the last few years.
</p><p>When I run a search, I expect relevant results, according to the parameters I specify in the search syntax. I then expect to decide for myself which of these results are most likely to be useful - i.e., I do not want random results, including terms I have specifically excluded, with an arbitrary limit on number of hits returned. 
</p><p>Examples may help. I have sought information on correlations between mammography OR sonography AND metastatic disease, for one example, or an MSDS with the LD50 of elemental sulphur, which I use as a garden fungicide and do not want to harm wildlife with, for another, or on the best way to add insulating night curtains to existing window treatments, for a third, or the effects of B AND/OR D vitamin deficiency on cognition in the elderly.  None of this information is so obscure that nobody would ever be expected to look for it. It should also be quite easy to set very specific terms for all these searches and obtain highly relevant results.
</p><p>Yet search engines in general have become so badly dumbed down that none of those searches now return clean - or even relevant - results for many hits they bring back - no matter what I do to limit the search. Even IxQuick is beginning to bring back more and more trash hits.
</p><p>It now appears that IxQuick has been completely savaged. It returns ten results, no more, one page, no more. It ignores normal search syntax such as quotes, + and - signs, and Boolean operators. The Advanced function page is a placebo - does not clearly allow for expanding the number of hits returned, and ignores input into the ""restrictive"" search fields that are available there, such that one might as well not use them at all. Also, it seems impossible to change search settings to any meaningful extent on the Options page (in the wake of the latest update). [Side comment: combining the cookie and data cache access into one radio button was a really dirty trick to play on those of us who like to clear the cache independently. Please separate them in your next update.]
</p><p>I am still able to obtain multi-page results if I search in DuckDuckGo, but I set IxQuick as default for a reason. I would like to continue using it.  Are there any fixes available through Firefox that will allow me to resume ""intelligent"" searches in IxQuick now, and obtain extensive results that actually conform to the search terms I have specified?
</p><p>Thank you. Apologies for any snark - it's not intended. As an intelligent user, I find this incredibly frustrating, and every time it changes, it becomes worse, not better.

Couple years back this was happening in Safari and Chrome but not FFox. That is why I switched to FFox. Since later upgrades, Safari &amp; Chrome no longer display gibberish. All forums I went to had no answers not even tech support. So I stayed with FFox. Don't care to go back. Has always performed smoothly. But if this new glitch isn't fixed very shortly, I'll go back to them. Going forward with new upgrade only to go backward with text displays.

It also resets my preferences - which is truly annoying because it defaults to Yahoo search, which is not my preferred search engine. This happens at least once a day.

Something is triggering playback of the audio portion of the video. The viewable video player IS NOT PLAYING however. For example if I were to click the play button this will introduce a SECOND audio plus the video video.  Also the audio auto-plays until I leave the page and the problem resumes all over again if I go to another edit page for another video. This problem began a week or two ago and I notice it doesn't happen on Google Chrome so I'm assuming it's related to the browser.

1217577,1526267554,Firefox will not play view.yahoo videos,"<p>Firefox 59.0.2/3 on MacOS 10.12.06 will not play streaming videos from
<a href=""http://view.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">view.yahoo.com</a> - I tried several different videos.
	Symptom: When I try to play a video I get a black
box, clicking on it has no effect. Sometimes I get a brief image from
the video in the black box along with a small black box off to the
side, but both quickly disappear.
	What I can do: I can play videos from youtube and pbs.
Some other browsers, eg. chrome, will play the yahoo
videos, but initially Safari would not, giving the same results as
Firefox. When I choose the Safari per website option to disable content
blockers, the previously brief image remained and I could then play the
video.
	What I tried: I disabled all the content blockers I could find,
including: ad blockers and flash restrictions.  I reinstalled Firefox,
going from 59.0.2 to 59.0.3 with no change in behavior; I reinstalled
flash.  I tried restarting Firefox in safe mode, with the same results
as above.
</p><p>I prefer to stick with Firefox, so are any suggestions to fix this
problem?

I am totally frustrated with FF. It used to work very beautifully in the last few years until recently I found that one update screwed my browsing experience. Right now , whether in safe mode or not,private browsing even with hardware acceleration disabled , it won't load pages . For example when I luckily arrived to open a page containing links , when I try to open those links on a new tab, the tab won't load the page at all, I have to keep opening tabs till at least one successfully opens , sometimes I have to try twice or three times to get it open on a new tab, I tried the same with a new window, same problem. I saw that there are others who had the same issue and probably still have this issue till now. 
I dare to say this is a bug that need to be fixed. I had disabled all add-ons ,no luck, even uninstalled FF and removed firefox profiles, no luck. However FF is working fine on my other PC, both are windows 7. I don't want to go back to Internet explorer, Chrome is fine but I liked FF.Please share your solution if you had this issue resolved. FF developers, please provide some fix. By the way, I tried the beta FF version 61 ,I have the same issue as well.

Some of the changes of the Quantum project I hate with all my heart. The activity stream (that I see whenever I open a new tab) is one of them. I turned it off as soon as I knew how to do it.

I use the Authy Authenticator app on my Iphone with the Lastpass account set up to provide a 6 digit authenticator code whenever I sign into Lastpass.  Since the Authy Authenticator integrates with the Google Authenticator, I am provided the 2FA codes and can successfully sign into Lastpass using Chrome and Opera Browsers.  However when I use the Firefox browser, a tab pops up that says Google Authenticator; but nothing displays so I can put in the 6 digit code I see on my Authy App for Lastpass.  The tab in Firefox freezes and I have to use another browser to sign into Lastpass.
</p><p>Is there something else I need to configure to use the Firefox Quantum browser?

1217739,1526357913,How do I get remember passwords without setting master password,"<p>Before, once I set Options to remember password, life was good. Then the upgrade. Understand this is for security, yadda yadda BUT I do NOT want to remember ANOTHER Master Password. I just want Firefox to remember that I have set Remember Password like every single time (repeat: every single time) I open the browser. It's gotten to the point that if I don't set EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the browser to remember password, Roboform won't work. This Roboform issue only started after this last update so I don't know what happened and all but my backup option is now no longer an option. I may sound like an old, cranky lady and, to be truthful, I am. Been using computers since late 1970's with a CP/M system and two 4"" floppy drives (well, it was really one floppy drive where I swapped out two floppies). It's not like I'm unreasonable (yes, it's okay to snicker) but these little annoyances are getting to me. I will still use Firefox over Windows, for absolutely sure. Just help me out. At least let Roboform fill the fields without my having to set privacy every single time I open the browser. Thanks. Keep up the great work. It is appreciated.

1217832,1526415358,"Are you going to fix the problem with Firefox freezing the PC when it stumbles upon and loads ""badly coded"" websites?","<p>Or whatever is the problem?
ok, some context.
Ever since I upgraded (with some lag because, yes, I did expect this, to some extent) to quantum, Firefox is regularly freezing my PC by hogging ALL of the RAM. (Win7 PC, 8GB RAM)
</p><p>I checked via taskmanager etc and usually it´s some variant of millions of javascript or scripts being loaded. For whatever reason, since most cases I am not doing anything active with it, just reading in my ao3-tab.
And the thing is, as I said, I expected some problems. The last big update before that I had similar problem, though to a lesser extent. But with a few updates that went away. Not this time.
</p><p>It appears to be fairly independent of the number of tabs opened, too. I am admittedly something of a tab-messy, so my first attempt to was to cut down to a few windows with maybe a dozen to twenty tabs in-all. I even started a with a single window and like 3 tabs. No diff. and no, no youtube there, btw. Deactivated the few addons I had on. no diff.
</p><p>I really did not want to have to google this problem, so I waited, hoping for a helpful update. and no improvements came my way. So I did look here, and yes I did have to update my graphics drivers (geforce) and yes I did deactivate the Hardware acceleration in Options - General, and yes I did tell Firefox to assume my PC is on the weak side and use ""2"" instead of the default.
To exactly no effect.
</p><p>And I keep reading, in each of these threads, that, hey, maybe the user should check which evil website is doing this, and some grumpy lizard part of my brain has by now turned into a volcano. I had my PC ""freeze"" three, hah, no, four times while I typed this here. (as in, the RAM maxxes out for periods of.. up to half an hour, during which the entire PC is best left untouched)
</p><p>Yes, I do have other windows open. No, I did not do anything with them. Are you seriously trying to tell my that the new and improved browser of the future cannot handle that? did you somehow include something that makes the browser routinely look through all its tabs and just reload them (and any potential crap-scripts) because hey shits and giggles?
</p><p>And, please, are you really telling me this new improved browser was not checked in how he deals with websites that are not made to standard??
This is the internet. This has been the internet for decades. any kind of standard being used in any kind of fashion is a niceity, a fluke almost, are you really telling me to just not browse sites that might (as has unfortunately become the norm) load something or other from other websites, be it for ads or statistics or whatever?? really????
</p><p>No I have not killed my profile yet. I have used this profile for several years, and now I actually went and got a tool to export my PW-data. Getting ready to torch it. Will update if that fixes it.
</p><p>But, really. What exactly did you do that made a functioning browser into this awful zombie? and can you please fix it. Because seriously, much as I got my rant on, the very idea of version 0.3 of the newest bestest browser reacting to uncomfortable/messy websites/content in such  manner is just absurd. As is the idea of routinely reloading every tab, no matter if it is currently needed. That would certainly be a double killer, to load all scripts/media and then do it in a way that makes it into an eternal loop of doom. please tell me it´s not like that. And please tell me when it is/might be fixed. because like this I can´t use it.

</p><p>- upon start the browser directly asks for master password (normally I'm asked for the master password only when I really need it)
- no browsing history is shown in the address bar
- enter key and 'Go to...' button do not work at all (I can only open a site if it is bookmarked)
- when I go to browser's options there is nothing under 'Search' section - in other words the content cannot be loaded or displayed
- when I open 'Saved Logins' dialog there is nothing 
- there are no *corrupt files in my profile directory

I can start/use/exit the browser as many times as I want and it works fine. So it looks like the access to the saved logins breaks something.

Well, recently (with a hazy memory after having not created any new profile for a couple of years) I created a new temporary profile for testing and I forgot to specify a subfolder. Instead I specified just the parent folder (C:\Firefox Profiles) as the path for the profile.     
Well, as a result, when I was finished using the new temporary profile and I went to delete it, the profile manager deleted the entire parent folder. All of my profiles were deleted.  
Not only were they deleted, they were deleted in such a way that forensic file recovery software wasn't able to recover them.  
It seems like it would be logical and fairly easy to have the profile manager run a quick check before deleting a profile's folder to see if any of the other profiles are dependent on that folder, then alert the user if so.

1218012,1526504367,"""Open Link in New Tab"" item JUMPS AROUND on Context Menu!","<p>In FF v60, I noticed some strange behavior with the context menu when right-clicking on a link. 
</p><p>The ""Open Link in New Tab"" menu item arbitrarily jumps around on the menu with each new tab opened, even though I have CSS that specifically sets it as the second menu item.
</p><p>Sometimes it will become the last item on the menu, or the third to last item, or third from the top.  It literally changes places at random!  See attached screen images.
</p><p>Things worked fine in v59, but v60 presents this very puzzling issue.
</p><p>Here is the CSS from my userChrome.css file to make ""Open Link in New Tab"" the second menu item...
</p><pre>#contentAreaContextMenu &gt; * { -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2; }
#context-openlink { -moz-box-ordinal-group: 1 !important;}

#placesContext &gt; * {-moz-box-ordinal-group:4;}
#placesContext_open\:newwindow {-moz-box-ordinal-group:1!important;}
#placesContext_open\:newtab {-moz-box-ordinal-group:2!important;}
#placesContext_open {-moz-box-ordinal-group:3!important;}
</pre>
<p>Why is the context menu continuously rotating the ""Open Link in New Tab"" item to different positions?
</p><p>Quite frustrating when years of ""muscle memory"" has trained me to look for this as the second menu item, and now my custom CSS no longer holds it in place :-)

1218029,1526865393,The browser session does not restore my last session but hundreds of deleted tabs from various past sessions. How do I fix this and report it to Mozilla?,"<p>1.  This usually causes a crash, today it didn't, but it has extraordinarily slowed all functions of my laptop, including typing this which is difficult with a 5-10 second keystroke delay. I am experiencing resistance to trying to close each tab individually, and I am unable to close the browser window at all- the ""close"" button merely becomes red but does not close, the only way to close it is to restart the computer again. 
I seem to recall that all of these problems started sometime over a year ago. I have been patiently waiting for the solutions to come as ""bug fixes"" with the new versions of Firefox, but none of these (the following) have been fixed, nor can I stand these infuriating, time-burning ""troubleshooting"" days anymore- after a whole year of it I'm seriously burned out. Mostly because I am not a webtech and I have very limited energy and stamina.
</p><p>The other issue I noticed is that the ""warn me when about to close multiple tabs"" (pop-up) fails regularly and now I can't seem to locate it in my settings ""options"" to see what's going on. It seems to work if I open a second window- having 2 separate browsing sessions open at once, but not if there is only one and especially if it's the one that session restore opens.
</p><p>2.  All of the problems began to accelerate (snowball) most recently this year when the Firefox session restore stopped working as well, so in order to save what I was working on I had to regularly create browsing session bookmarks before computer shutdowns or installing updates to continue my work where I left off. But those began to fail shortly after creating them, as when I would open the saved session ""in all tabs"", the webpages would not load, showing no URL in the address bar and a white page. This gave way to pages eventually loading, but missing backpage info entirely- with regular session restore (when it used to work correctly) you could go to the other web content of the tab you were working on by clicking the backspace arrow, but the entire history was now missing, as was the backspace arrow button. But, checking  my ""history"" menu showed that it had not been cleared (deleted) and was still saving all of the web content I was actively browsing. It was just not saving as full web content as bookmarked, multi-tab ""sessions"" in bookmarks.
</p><p>3.  But today was the first time that I tried to reopen my previous session and discovered that 95% of my bookmarks menus were missing. I have wasted an entire day on this trying to find answers- I was able to use ""restore bookmarks"", but there was a great deal missing when the bookmarks were restored/replaced. I backed up my work related research bookmarks last time I signed into my account, but now (this leads to the next major dilemma) the sign in page now fails and will not work, nor will ""sync your account"". 
</p><p>4.  Everything that I backed up that was very important for my work remains unsynced and trapped in my account, along with all of my preferred settings (which are not as important as my history and bookmarks). How is it that suddenly after 7 years my password no longer works and I can't sign into my account- even though I never changed it? 
Mozilla has not fixed this yet. I need to be able to not only sign into my account,  but recover it at this point, specifically my saved bookmarks and history. The only option that Mozilla posted was to ""reset password"" or ""recover your account"", but by clicking on ""recover my account"" OR ""reset password"" they both will erase all of my data saved there!! How is this a solution if am trying to recover my data?!
</p><p>I have tried to upload my 2 screenshots but it doesn't seem to be working- the uploading is stuck spinning in an endless ""loading"", it's been doing that for over an hour on the first photo. I'm going to try posting regardless- maybe I can try through editing later to add them.

the other profile (created 1 month ago) seems to have no browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled in about:config.

</p><p>I use 'firefox -P *** -no-remote -chrome 'http://localhost:***' in ff 40, it works well. After I updated to ff52, message 'If you're trying to load a webpage, do not pass --chrome' returned. So I view the source code in nsBrowserContentHandler.js, I found the follow code:

         let features = ""chrome,dialog=no,all"" + this.getFeatures(cmdLine);

</p><p>So all the previous questions and solutions for this problem suggest it's addons and probably the users fault for the slowness of quantum. However I disagree
Firefox 56, with all the same addons runs perfectly fine continuously with multiple tabs open, and my normal usage for extended periods of time, when switching tabs, minimizing, etc.
</p><p>Firefox Quantum with all the same addons does not, after extended time periods it slows down extremely, when switching tabs, minimizing, etc. 
This includes the nightly, the beta, and the developer version, which I tried all three of because THEY had been suggested to fix the problem as well.
I even attempted the about:memory ""solution"" which did absolutely nothing.
I want a solution and/or a Fix, other than my current which is having uninstalled quantum completely and reverted to 56 version, I would LIKE quantum to work.

I've got a problem with restoring my yesterday's session. I'm using Windows 10 with Fireox ESR 52.8.0 on it. Last night my Windows updated. Today when I opened Mozilla for the first time after it, it shows no history at all and the opened tab says that there's difficulty with restoring the last session, but in the window below the only card is the main page of Mozilla. I always keep a bunch of tabs opened and obviously they disappeared. I wanted to bring  the AppData folder of Mozilla back to the previous version, as I always do in such cases,  but it only shows me the version from today. I checked the databases in the profile folder and I see that some data is still inside them. It looks a bit weird for me though: in places.sqlite I see some pages that I visited quite a time ago, but I see much more entries in formhistory.sqlite, and it contains at least some of search queries I typed yesterday. I would like to ask for any help with restoring the session, as I suppose it should be possible assuming the data is not corrupted, but I've got little understanding how is it organized there and how Mozilla handle the database. Any hints appreciated.

1218334,1526772164,Switch to tab with %: painful keyboard key press/release combination,"<p>I love the firefox Feature to quickly switch to an opened tab; especially when there are many opened tabs. The method is as follows:
</p><p>1. Type Ctrl-L to access the address bar
</p><p>2. Type ""% "" in the address bar by pressing Shift+5 (on a US keyboard) followed by a space. This restricts the search to only opened tabs (no bookmark and search engine results).
</p><p>3. Type a query that identifies an opened tab (for instance, ""mail"" almost always identifies my gmail tab).
</p><p>4. Use Tab to select the tab of choice, and hit Enter to switch.
</p><p>This feature is really nice when many opened tabs are opened. However, the key combination that I use to use the feature is really painful. I have to press Ctrl+L, then release Ctrl (otherwise % will not show up), then press Shift+5 to produce a ""%"", then hit space, then release Shift (otherwise shift kills the switch to open tab feature), then type the query.
</p><p>This sequence of key presses/releases is very painful for my fingers; it's very hard to touch/type this sequence without making mistakes. I have to explicitly think about the sequence of key presses/releases and using the feature ends up slowing me more than anything.
</p><p>Am I missing something and is there a better way to use the switch to type feature only using the keyboard?

1218364,1526796273,CTRL + D is a complete nuisance.,"<p>So this has been a problem plaguing Firefox for as long as I can remember..
I am always using CTRL + F to search pages. I do this very regularly. Of course, with that I often hit CTRL + D by accident. I wouldn't say it's a problem to have it bound to bookmarks. What the problem, and the inherent nuisance is: CTRL+D automatically places the page as a bookmark, thus making me have to fix the issue by removing the bookmark. More often than not, I've already clicked away or done something that makes the little ""Page Bookmarked"" pop-up disappear... causing me to hunt it down in the (still, after so many years) very ugly and unorganized Bookmarks Library... so I have to hit alt, bookmarks, show all bookmarks or ctrl + shift + b (but that's a nasty hotkey that requires two hands or a very foreign feeling thumb placement so I click my way through instead.. anyways, back on topic..)
</p><p>I just want the ability, or perhaps a suggestion for the future: Don't make CTRL + D create the bookmark. Make that pop-up that says ""Page Bookmarked"" actually something like ""Page to be Bookmarked"" with a ""Accept/Yes"" instead of Done... Why? I am 100% sure that this key is more often *accidentally* hit than it is hit purposefully. I am sure if you were to record such a stat as ""Was this bookmark subsequently removed after hitting CTRL + D within user's current session"" and pingsender that back to your database where you can calculate all of this on a nice little chart or what-have-you, that you would see I am correct :P
</p><p>There may be a plugin out there that I haven't found but it's always been my experience that the more plugins you have- the more bogged down you are, especially with more windows/tabs.

I was forced to upgrade my MacOS from El Captain (using v59 Firefox) to High Sierra in order to use TurboTax for 2017 tax year. I then started receiving error messages in both Firefox and Google, and my long list of saved bookmarks in Firefox would not launch as normal.  I searched the web and got advice to upgrade to Firefox 60.0.1 Quantum when using High Sierra.  Nothing has changed, I still get errors.....not always, but errors here and there when launch Firefox.

1218463,1526873625,Todays Update Has Made My Hidden City Game On Facebook Painfully Slow,"<p>Today 5/20/2018, I opened Firefox and it was automatically updated. After the update I used my bookmark for Hidden City on Facebook (it's not the Gameroom app) and while the app was loading twice I got the yellow banner message that a webpage is slowing down my browser. I have gotten that message before and I always just wait instead of clicking Wait or Stop and the message goes away the app continues loading. After the loading screen the game was unbearably slow. My cursor moved around the screen fine but everything in the game moved slow. The CPU usage was 60-64 and the Memory usage was 63-71 and 4 firefox processes were running. When I first used the FireFox Quantum browser to play Hidden City was slow and I followed help page to fix it, but this recent update seems to have undone what I tweaked. The current version of the browser I see in the about FireFox is 60.0.1 (64 bit). Can someone help me tweak the browser so I can play game Hidden City? And I would like to also play my Secret Society game (it's the same type of game as Hidden City) in this browser but I haven't because I was concerned both games would be to much data for the browser to hold and would cause it to slow down. Is there a way I can store the data for both games so it doesn't effect the browsers performance and protect the data from being accidentally deleted when I clean out the browsers history? Also, Firefox is not my default browser, I only use it to play Hidden City because Internet Explorer can't be used to play it. Also I already have Adobe Flash on my computer but I can't use it in Firefox, when I tried to check out Secret Society there was a message saying I need to download flash player. How do I enable Flash Player so I can play Secret Society? I tried following the article I found in help but I don't see the flash player in my add ons, and the other add-ons I have is UBlock and it's enabled, and No Script which I just added today to see if it would help but I disabled it because it blocked java script and Hidden City won't work without it. If you need more information just let me know and I will try my best to supply it. Thank you for your time.

If I go one or more levels into the selected website, I can return to the initial website, but not to the home page news item. To return to home page, I have to right-click the go-back arrow and left-click the home page topic from the history. I know what you are thinking right about now, but I understand what I'm saying.

<p>I then tried to create a new Firefox profile and to start sync all over again, which was also not working. I am operating a Mozilla Sync Server on one of my own private servers and in the server logs, I noticed that sync tried to fetch one million new bookmarks from the server until I cancelled the process after some hours.
</p><p>After noticing that I had a look into my bookmarks. There I figured out that my bookmarks were completely screwed up. They were doubled and tripled in the ""Other Bookmarks"" folder and --- strangely --- they were somehow linked. So deleting a particular bookmark in the ""Other Bookmarks"" folder deleted it also in the ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" folder, for example. I decided to completely delete all bookmarks and restore them from a backup. Now, at least in the bookmark manager, everything seems fine.
</p><p>I also deleted my Firefox sync account and registered again to delete all data on the server side and to start with a fresh sync. However, the sync is now still failing with errors similar to the one above.

Since last update FF 60.0.1 my links that are supposed to open in a new tab are just blanks.
the only way to open those links are with a right click and 'open in new tab'
some do not works at all, for instance, google last confidential terms notification. i just can't open that page at all, because right click on it show a file not found message.
Same if i restore a session, all the tabs that were in background are blanks with no way to reload those pages as the reload button is greyed. But the pages titles are showing, just not the page.

FF version: 60.0.1 
</p><p>I updated FF a couple of days ago (from v59) and I encountered two severe problems until now:
1) FF crashed **for no apparent reason** after about one hour of use.  I don't remember when was last time that FF crashed. Years maybe. (Unfortunately, I cannot connect the crash to anything I did and I can't reproduce it.)  
2) When I exited FF **normally** today, I saw 3 firefox.exe processes still remaining in Task Manager. This is not normal at all. 
</p><p>Moreover, I consider abnormal the fact that when I open a single FF instance with the new version, there are 5 (five) firefox.exe processes installed in Task Manager!!! Although this is not a problem per se, I believe it has to do with FF crashing and not terminating normally.
</p><p>In 15-20 years I am using FF, I have never encountered such problems in general, esp. after installing an update!
</p><p>What are FF people doing? Why do they destroy working versions to produce problematic ones? It looks insane.

That the problem was truly browser specific seemed  to be borne out by the fact that I managed to get the required results using Internet Explorer (although this in turn seemed to have its own quirks).

1. Has anyone else run into similar problems with epost.

1218617,1526965456,YouTube videos stop after 25 minutes XP,"<p>So, this began a few years ago. Apparently connected to the codec issues surrounding XP and YouTube's choice to change how their videos play back, namely to the exclusion of flash. I can get the flash player going but that lacks the nice video quality of 1080x720. So not much point there.
</p><p>It happens at any quality setting. Videos stop at 25:21, or in other cases 23:18. The sound keeps playing, the video freezes. Moving the timeline will allow the video to play for another 25/23 minutes. This of course does not happen in Chrome, but the reason I don't watch videos in chrome is a different color saturation issue; the videos are washed out there and I suppose that is a separate thread on another forum.

Since a few days ago, after updating firefox, suddenly all the top sites shortcuts which were on new tabs disappeared. and not only that. all new tabs I open, they are ""Fully"" blank. I can't even see the firefox icon at the top left, or the gear Icon on top right of the black pages. I refreshed firefox a few times and each time they came back but after a few minutes they disappeared again. at first I thought maybe adblockplus is causing the problem. but even after removing it, it happened again.
Until I finally noticed this only happens whenever I refresh, and then try to change the position of the tiles, or edit them. the moment I touch the tiles and want to edit them or change their place, they disappear in new tabs.
What should I do?

</p><p>1-FireFox is full of ads and Firefox ad blocker is weak it doesn't even block most ads! when I click on something a new tap get opened and I find a page or a website or something I have no relation with it! 
For example I am in a modding website and I click on search button then a new tap comes and I find another website or page about how to be rich and that is not what I want!. 
By the way a lot of people prefer Google Chrome  browser because it has no ads however I prefer Firefox browser please remove the ads from firefox, Make firefox browser clean of ads.
</p><p>2-Where is the register button?! I took maybe 15 minutes to find a solution to register in this website then I knew that the only way to register is by volunteering but I don't want to volunteer I just want to register to ask a question! I am sure that I am not the only one who is talking about that there is no register button, Please put a register button so people can register quickly.
</p><p>3-I have an old account and I forgot its password so I wrote my email to receive a password reset link and I waited maybe 2 minutes or 1 minute and I didn't receive the link so I tried again by writing my email and again I didn't receive the link!
</p><p>Suggestions:-
</p><p>1-Please put a  ""|([fast])|"" VPN for Firefox browser because some websites are blocked in other countries.
2-I know that you have many products like firefox focus so can you make a VPN can content a lot of countries please?

It's as if the Windows GUI is writing itself over the top of the Firefox windows.

<ul><li> The error in the console for each script/style CDN resource is: <strong>None of the ""sha256"" hashes in the integrity attribute match the content of the subresource.</strong>
</li><li> The error message in the network tab for each resource is: <strong>The connection used to fetch this resource was not secure</strong>

<p><strong>Steps to reproduce</strong>
</p><p>You can reproduce the problem with one of the above URLs and place it directly in the URL of the FireFox browser. The resource should load in the browser window but after pressing <em>CTRL+F5</em> at least one time (could be up to 5 times) an error will appear. I can duplicate this from multiple PCs although we are located in the Netherlands so maybe a timing issue or something? 
This does not happen with any other resources from other CDNs that we are using like (we use integrity checks with these as well):

<ul><li> &lt;script src=""<a href=""https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js</a>"" integrity=""sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa"" crossorigin=""anonymous""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</li></ul>
<p>My environment:
</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Pro 64bit patched to latest
</li><li> FireFox 60.0.1 (64-bit)
</li></ul>
<p><em>My question</em>
</p><p>Is this an issue that is specific to <a href=""https://cdnjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">cdnjs</a> and they must resolve this or is this an issue with FireFox or is this an issue with how we are requesting the resource? Is there anything else that we can do to get the ball rolling on fixing this (depending on the actual source of the problem)?

I've sorted my bookmarks, and when I don't filter them by a tag, they appear alphabetically in the sidebar. However, if I filter them by a tag I've assigned to some bookmarks (by typing the tag into the text box at the top of the bookmarks sidebar) the tagged bookmarks appear in what appears to be an arbitrary order. Since displaying them in alphabetical order would be the easiest thing to do -- since the bookmarks are already alphabetized! -- why is there extra work done to scramble the bookmarks when filtered by a tag?

Also Firefox seems to work fine on other forums I belong to and post on.

I have also been in contact with two other people that also use Firefox and they also have the same problem with posting on <a href=""http://overunity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">overunity.com</a>.  As I post there fairly often I would really like to see a solution to this problem.  Or a way to work around it if possible.  I can get my  posts to look okay as long as I remember to add an extra hit of the enter key when posting but I don't consider that to be a good solution.

1219127,1527252099,Isn't sharing browser fingerprint without user consent illegal (in relation to GDPR)?,"<p>Dear Mozilla,
</p><p>First, please know that I am a fervent defender of freedom and that for this reason, I try to only use Firefox as a web browser.  I think that you have done an outstanding job so far and I encourage you to continue in this direction.  I am grateful that organisations like yours exist.
</p><p>The following is thus not so much criticism: you should much more consider it as suggestions and maybe as a list of (arguably) potential law breaches which you might want to address.
Please note that I am no lawyer and that I might be wrong in the way I interpret the GDPR or parts of it.
Please also note that I am an experienced software engineer, with more than a decade of web app development and design experience. 
</p><p><br>
In the context of GDPR, I think that sending ""browser fingerprint"" information to website servers without receiving user consent for every single website is illegal processing of data - either from Mozilla's Firefox or from the website itself (I don't know for sure).
</p><p>I would enjoy seeing in Firefox a feature which would allow users to avoid browser fingerprinting.  I would like to decide by myself what data the browser shares and with which website it shares the data.
</p><p>According to GDPR, consent must be a positive, well described, easily understandable action done by the user.  Thus, by default, sharing any data with a website other than what is strictly required should be disabled until the user specifies his consent.
</p><p>Of course, keeping proof and records of consents should also be done.
</p><p>By the way, web browsing works:
- without sharing the list of system fonts - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing the screen size and colour depth - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing browser plugin detail - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing hash of canvas fingerprint - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without allowing supercookies at all - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing the timezone - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing the Hash of WebGL fingerprint - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing the platform (Linux, windows...) - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing the user agent - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without sharing touch support - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
- without specifying if cookies are enabled or disabled - this is not essential and is thus subject to user's consent.
</p><p>These features are often not really useful to implement web applications, and many web applications could be or are implemented without these.
</p><p><br>
I know that this is an incredibly complicated matter, as it would mean that it would break some features of websites, but that is what is required by the GDPR.
</p><p>This kind of feature would enable users to regain control of their data (and here, it is data that most users ignore that they share).
</p><p>If any website of Mozilla collects this data, I would also recommend that you require explicit user consent before you collect it and process it in any way.
</p><p>You have my email, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

</p><p>I imagine that the pages that don't get retrieved from cache are those that have a ""no-cache"" tag or tag with a short expiration time. To try to bypass this I set browser.cache.check_doc_frequency to 2, which should force Firefox to always retrieve from cache, and restarted. But the problem with those pages still remain when going offline.
</p><p>I also tried to increase the cache size (both disk and memory), but to no avail. Both kinds of cache are enabled.
</p><p>I remember that with older versions of Firefox there was a combination of settings or an add-on that forced Firefox to retrieve from cache when offline (browser.cache.check_doc_frequency = 2), and to behave ""normally"" (browser.cache.check_doc_frequency = 3) when online. No such add-on seem to exist for Firefox Quantum (no surprise).

</p><p>My issue: I originally had snippets on the bottom of tabs. Sometimes, I ignored them. Sometimes, I selected the ""x"" to remove them. Now, I have a white banner covering the bottom of web pages.
</p><p>Additional details:
1. If I right-click the banner area, I get a MS Windows dialogue box (display settings, etc.), even though it appears to be inside a Firefox window.
2. When I close Firefox, the banner disappears.
3. I cannot access the bottom of websites I frequent in full-screen because stationery links are now hidden under the banner.
4. Scrolling does not help, unless I resize the window. When the window is less than full-screen, the banner goes away.
</p><p>What may have happened: I noticed the issue shortly after I missed clicking on the ""x"" on a message. Bad aim. I then tried selecting the ""x"" again, and it wouldn't close. I know. Makes no sense to me either. But, it is the only somewhat related moment I can remember before this happened.
</p><p>This is what I've done so far (not in any particular order):
1. I unchecked, checked, then unchecked the ""snippets"" box on the Options home tab.
2. I closed Firefox and re-opened it in safe mode twice.
3. I refreshed Firefox once.
4. I re-booted my laptop.

Move the Open Menu (hamburger) button to the left hand side in Firefox 60. Unfortunately, ""customize"" does not allow one to move the Open Menu button in FF60 (it is greyed out in ""Customize""). I can do each of these steps separately with the following CSS customizations in the UserChrome.css file inside my profile, but am not sure how to combine the two together.
For 1. the following works: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1185426"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1185426</a>

but combining them messes up the position of the Open Menu button - I am not skilled in CSS.
Can anyone suggest a CSS that will do both tasks together?
Or is there a simpler solution to both that I am missing?
</p><p>The two CSS respectively are: 
1. Move the tabs to below the address bar and bookmarks toolbar:
________________

  For best results, show Title Bar or Menu Bar */
  #nav-bar { /* main toolbar */
  -moz-box-ordinal-group: 1 !important;

    #PersonalToolbar { /* bookmarks toolbar */
   -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;
   }
   #TabsToolbar { /* tab bar */
 -moz-box-ordinal-group: 3 !important;
   }
</pre>
<p>________________
2. Move the Open Menu button to the LHS:
________________
</p>
<pre>/*
 * Move the hamburger menu to the top left, before the first tab

#PanelUI-button {

1219451,1527483508,[security] regular hash check on preinstalled addons,"<p>A simple addon could do this automatically very quickly and easily, by downloading the latest addons at semi random intervals, and comparing hashes; if the hashes are not already available on firefoxes own addons page.
</p><p>Today I had noticed the user interface in disconnect totally changed in my firefox browser. It had a clean vertical column listing only google, facebook, twitter, and a few other websites; Each was like a rectangular button. Nothing else was visible. It was completely different than the original. I should have took a screenshot and backed up the extension but failed to do so. I uninstalled the addon and re-installed it from firefox's website; The UI immediately went back to normal. I confirm signature checks were in fact enabled. I'm curious what kind of security firefox implements. I know its supposed to only allow signed addons, but does it go one step further and do regular hash checks to ensure it has not been modified or replaced with malware? I believe this will be a necessary step in order to mitigate against many zero day threats or vulnerabilities within browser signature verification systems.

After deleting history I first noticed that I was unable to log into Google. I previously had chosen to stay logged in but never had any problems logging out and into my other accounts. Now when I go to sign in I can input my gmail address but the next page (after clicking next) never loads so I can't enter my password... I AM able to log into Facebook but have had ongoing weird glitches with Facebook that are usually video interface related. That's been going on for some time and probably unrelated but I'm telling you for the sake of thoroughness. I discovered the other day that I also was having the same  log in problems with Paypal and  CIBC ... no error messages, just not loading the next page so can't login...

</p><p>In this window I could see on the left in a 'Tree-Form' way everything about my history, my bookmarks and somewhere in the middle my downloads.
</p><p>I could filter them, search inside them, both with bits of the name or the URL, edit them (the bookmarks), delete them (both bookmarks and history) or make any other changes I wanted to. It made my life a lot easier, since I had control in everything that I wanted to find, regarding my visits or my bookmarks.
</p><p>But after the last May 2018 update (I think), this window has been changed a lot.
There are still some columns and some buttons like 'organize' or 'sort by' etc but it isn't the same as before and it is very difficult to handle it. No 'tree-form' look, no full showing of the properties of each bookmark or visit, no ability for filtering (in fact it shows nothing unless I choose a bookmark from the left 'kind-of-sidebar', then I have to go to the columns and choose some, and sort them for example, 'By Date', etc).
It's a mess, comparing to what it was prior to these changes.
</p><p>Besides this, there is another problem: Some of my bookmarks go without my consent in a separate folder called 'other bookmarks'.
In this folder, I cannot make any changes: I cannot delete them or edit edit them or move them to another location
This is very annoying. 
Can't delete bookmarks?
It's unbelievable.

In the case of  Firefox, I always get the server reset or connection timeout pages. And there is definitely Internet going to my windows 10 PC.

Is there anything I can monkey with in about:config that might allow me to control this or get a desired result, like a memory limit or some value that defines how many pages from a past or crashed session can be restored to the version cached from that session?

After doing so, Facebook wouldn't allow me to paste stuff into the comments, and would make the comment section disappear alltogether.
If I turn it back on, Facebook works normally, but Youtube prevents me from pasting, and vice versa.
How can this be fixed?
Should I downgrade my Firefox, perhaps?

</p><p>I am interested in understanding whether browsers can handle TCP OOB data sent to them from a server? Is this something handled by the firefox browser explicitly? For instance, I request a web page (from my web server) using firefox browser, and I inject some OOB data in the middle of the response stream from the web server. It seems that if the OOB data is sent after an entire object (e.g. image, stylesheet, javascript) is returned, then the browser does not face any trouble in reading and loading that object. However, if the OOB data ended up being sent in the middle of an object's byte stream, then the browser may fail to load that object. I am not sure if the browser does not manage to receive the remaining of the object after the OOB data or it fails to load the object. 
</p><p>Any pointers would be very useful.
