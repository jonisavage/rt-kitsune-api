This was also puzzling me since firefox 54 would buffer till the end of the video but firefox 55 wouldn't, so I went trough the about:config and found those two lines once I chagned their values from (60, 30) to those above every single video I opened in firefox so far buffered till the end, you don't even need to restart the firefox just refresh the page for changes to take the effect. Hope this helped. ""

(September 5, 2018)","<p>I know this question has already been asked on the Mozilla Support Forums, but it's always better for there to be multiple answers to questions about Firefox since there's two sides to every story. I still am very much looking forward to reinstalling Firefox Stable on my 15.6"" full HD Dell Inspiron 7558 after I reset it and cleaned the drive a few days ago after numerous bug reports being sent to Mozilla and Microsoft about Firefox and Windows 10 build 17134, respectively. I'm also looking forward to the complete rollout of all of the major improvements to loading webpages in Firefox Stable, to be completed by Tuesday, January 29, 2019 when Firefox 65.0 Stable gets released to Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. At that point in time, I'll be able to read and bookmark articles seamlessly and with much greater reliability than I do here today, September 5, 2018! Lastly, I'm very much looking forward to each and every one of the planned reliability improvements and new features coming in the Windows 10 October 2018 update which will be released next month. I always love Microsoft's concerted efforts to act upon the bug reports users worldwide send to Microsoft to make Windows better every second Tuesday of every month and when a new build of Windows 10 is released about once every six months! I'll comment on how Firefox Stable is working for me on my Dell Inspiron 7558 every four weeks beginning October 30. I'll also donate $5.00 to Mozilla every first and fifteenth of each month to ensure I always get timely updates to the bugs in Firefox Stable. Now more than ever, it's very important my experience with Firefox Stable, my much preferred web browser, is as seamless and reliable as it can be every day when I read all kinds of articles on the World Wide Web, especially about what there is to explore in the United States, Canada, and Mexico! My sister very much enjoyed Cancun after she became a registered nurse and I expect to have a substantially similar experience with her once I find a career that I very much enjoy working to help, not just support myself!
</p><p>I know I threw a lot at you this morning. This long description of how I feel at 10:26 AM EDT is evidence that I'm very compassionate about the active development of Firefox. On top of a $5.00 donation every first and fifteenth of each month, I might become a beta tester of Firefox and report any performance issue, real or perceived, to Mozilla as soon as I take notice of any that may be present!

I reduced the window to about 80% of the screen and put task manager on the side with a google search page and this tab open. Extensions,only adblocker plus.

With Firefox closed, I went to open it and it took ages to open fully.  When it did open, the familiar toolbars were there, including my Bookmarks toolbar.  The Bookmarks toolbar is showing the icons of sites that I have put there, and it is showing my self-created folders on it (containing various website shortcuts etc).  The only difference is that the folders are grey instead of yellow. However, nothing is actually HAPPENING. No matter what I click on, I am not reaching any website whatsoever. I cannot actually go anywhere at all with Firefox.  My internet connection is working just fine.  I can open email software and I can open (and use) Internet Explorer.  Why has my Firefox just stopped functioning on my Windows 7 PC?  It is Firefox Quantum ESR 60.2.0esr.  I am typing this support request on my Windows 10 laptop where Firefox Quantum 62.0 is working ok!

(see uploaded images) Frankly, I don't see the logic of it, but who knows why you guys do the things you do sometimes. However, it has obviously increased the size of the dialog box. Consequently, when I expand the menu to ""choose"" folders and such, the entire thing is running off the bottom of my screen and it does this because I have to use the Windows magnifier, and I have it locked to the task bar and so this ""screenshot"" that is now attached to the bookmark menu dialog box is pretty much cut-off as well while at the bottom I can barely view any of my folders.
</p><p>Even though I think it's a silly idea, it probably works fine for those who don't have to use the Windows magnifier, but for me--it's irritating and I wish to know how I can go in and remove the feature, plese.
</p><p>Also, since you have moved the majority of the Menu bar features into the hamburger menu--why have you not yet moved the ""view"" tab into the hamburger menu as well? I use it quite a bit, being visually handicap ed and I wouldn't mind it much if you would include it in the hamburger menu as well so I don't have to keep opening the Menu bar just to use the View tab.

Upon upgraded to Firefox Ver. 60.2.0esr (32-bit) yesterday, however, I can not find where they are any more.

Since I have been saving HTML backup files regularly, I tried to follow that procedure to make a new backup and it did get saved to my H/D with the content organized like all the earlier ones. I tried to import one of the earlier backups. It seemed to work. Yet, I could not find where did it go afterwards.
I do find some single level / linear listings of many URLs of sites that I visited previously under ""Other Bookmarks"". Most of them were a long time ago (I can even remember the subject.). Although I spotted some that are fairly recent (within the past month). But, surprisingly, one has triple identical entries. This is very puzzling.
Please provide some guidance.

Thus, can't use CTRL-+ to restore zoom, though I can click in address bar or use Zoom in the hamburger menu.  Another thing that happens is when a Print box gets to the point where it displays the printer name, it cycles rapidly through the list of printers, and it is impossible to change back to any other than the last on the list.  It's behaving as if some key were chronically on, but it is the same with the two different kbds.  Things work fine in Microsoft applications.  Just upgraded today to 62.0.  Tried re-loading the installer and doing a fresh install, as well as trying the Refresh suggested in Troubleshooting, but neither of these produced any change.  It's as if some kind of crazy kbd shortcut was installed without my knowing it, but I can't find anything that seems that it would behave this way.
Sorry, but there's no screen shot that can show this thing.
It's possible that I hit some kind of 3-key rollover thing that changed this behavior, but I have no idea what this would be, much less how to fix it.

1232405,1536200754,How to reverse unwanted/unexpected changes from ESR version update.,"<p>I run Win7 x 64 Home with IE11 and have also been using a Firefox ESR version for years; I don't remember which version of it I had recently. For the last few days, Firefox had been 'overusing my Cpu' so when an update was announced today, I clicked the ""What's New"" button. Getting no information in the new tab, I foolishly updated anyway and got darkened tabs and changes to the address bar, things such as moving the reload button. I tried unsuccessfully to revert to an earlier 52.9 version and finally to this 60.0.1 version, but the changes remain. FWIW, I don't remember seeing any versions between those two, Anyway, I assume these changes aren't something normally adjustable in the Options, and don't see well enough to want to search everywhere for a solution. 
Can anyone shed some light on this matter, specifically explaining how to revert to the earlier format?
</p><p>Below is a snip of the top of my page and a bit of the desktop on the left, the page showing the darkened tabs.

1232411,1536203813,I detest Firefox Quantum. How can I go back to Firefox 29 - 56 ?,"<p>A pop-up appeared on my computer, asking me to install the latest upgrade to Firefox, stating that it was a “security upgrade”.  
</p><p>I installed it and found that I the whole appearance of Firefox had changed. 
</p><p>This new version is aesthetically disgusting with its sharp angles and black tabs, which are incredibly difficult to read. These tabs are now fixed at the top of the window, whereas I want them where I’ve always kept them, below the Bookmarks Toolbar. 
</p><p>I can’t put the tabs back where they belong, below the Bookmarks Toolbar, with Classic Theme Restorer because with this latest so-called “upgrade”,  Classic Theme Restorer is now “no longer compatible with my version of Firefox.”
</p><p>Why would anybody want tabs at the top of the window anyway ? It is now impossible to drag the Firefox window around my screen with the mouse as I’ve always done, and as I still do with any other window, because clicking and dragging on the tab at the top only creates a new duplicate Firefox window. 
</p><p>I’ve also lost other add-ons due to this so-called “upgrade” , including my regular FTP client, FireFTP and its associated FireFTP Button.
</p><p>I was happy with the way Firefox worked in the past: the Firefox I’m stuck wiyth now is an abomination.  I want to go back to the Firefox I had yesterday not this bullshit pretentious version I’ve been saddled with today.
</p><p>I want to return to Firefox 29 - 56 but of course, you won’t allow that. No one in the Firefox Empire is permitted to go back to what used to be !  
</p><p>I could possibly even accept that, if you’d bothered to inform us in your original pop-up that this was not just a security improvement but a full upgrade which, if accepted, would drastically alter Firefox on my computer.  Of course you didn’t say that, or anything like it. Your dishonesty is breath-taking.
</p><p>I’ve been using Firefox since the beginning: before that I was using the Mozilla browser. There used to be rhyme and reason to Firefox’s upgrades: now they just seem to be developments made for the sake of innovation, with no other reason. I’ve had a bellyful of the modern Firefox.  If you won’t let me change Firefox back to the way I want it, and always had it, I’ll just have to get rid of it.

Text addition to entry boxes is slow to appear (several seconds) or does not appear at all (blind text entry)
Top bars and menu bars break irrationally across the screen
Tabs may appear or not when created, sometimes they appear as a thick line to the right and can be clicked on ie they exist but are mostly hidden
Things tried -
Re-installing from Ubuntu Software Centre has given the best results - partial usability
Disabling and removing all add-ons was no use whatsoever (done manually and using Firefox's refresh)
Purging xul-ext-ubufox helped
Removing a lot of data and using Bleachbit to purge cache and clean free space helped
All hardware acceleration was unticked in Firefox Settings
Multiple instances of Firefox reduced to one (this worked when my WIndoze Firefox was uprgraded to 52 - small memory notebook)
Various about:config solutions were tried WHEN the entries were visible in the list including disabling Web3GL
</p><p>Now I have temporarily working solution. I say 'temporarily' because I am using it but any time today or tomorrow it could stop again
</p><p>If you have any other ideas, please let me know because I need the computer for work and I have lost so much time.....

1232471,1536239458,Unusual crashes,"<p>I haven't had a firefox crash in a long time, and this one seemed particularly odd because it started out with individual tabs crashing, then the browser, then the same happening again as the browser restored itself. I had since updated Firefox to the version that came out the same day and rebooted and it hasn't yet happened again, but I would like some help diagnosing if this is a deeper issue or just a fluke, as another application (the OSRS game client) seemed to close itself, albeit with no message, alongside Firefox while everything else was stable.

</p>
<pre>ntdll.exe
nvapi.dll

<p>As well as ntdll.exe alongside firefox.exe

1232474,1536240194,"How and where can one configure how tabs are created/managed? Why is TAB management so primitive, clunky and inconsistent in Firefox?","<p>I used to use an add-on for TAB management in older Firefox versions, because the way Firefox handles tab-configuration is generally horrid. I had hoped that would be fixed in the latest version, but it is NOT.
If the Firefox team prides itself on delivering a fast and user-friendly browser, why can't it allow users to configure tabs :
</p><p>-where they are created (at the end, at the beginning, right next to the actual tab, on the right or left of the actual tab)
-whether a new tab can be created with a double click on the titlebar, or right-clicking the titlebar or an existing tab
-whether we want a list of followed tabs and/or history or not
-to show only right-menu options for tab-management that I need / want OR to add menu options I'd like for tab-management
</p><p>Right now my experience of how tabs react, is downright irritating and inconsistent (and if has guided me more than once to the about:config page in a desperate attempt to make tabs at the very least consistent)
I love using Firefox (it all started with Netscape really) and I wouldn't use any other browser if possible, but, guys and girls... please fix the usability and flexibility of tabs... it would make firefox the right tool for EVERY browsing job

1232475,1536244074,"How can I prevent two different versions of Firefox, which are supposed to be running two separate profiles, from interfering with each other?","<p>As you probably know, support for Firefox ESR 52 ran out yesterday.
</p><p>As you probably also know, Firefox 52 was the last version to support non-WebExtension addons, several of which I rely upon heavily for my work, such as Scrapbook.
</p><p>If your first reaction to that last statement ISN'T to suspect I haven't tried to find an alternative, then you can skip this paragraph. Otherwise read on. I have been searching for and evaluating alternatives ever since I heard for the first time that Scrapbook's days were numbered, but none of them offer adequate functionality. In order to work efficiently, I need to be able to archive and manage web pages, PDF files, images, MS Word files, notes and more in a folder tree structure directly within the browser UI, view archived content without an internet connection, use highlighting and commenting functions, use full-text search functions, and so on. In a nutshell, I need Scrapbook. If after reading this you still think there is a viable alternative that I missed, then I'm all ears.
</p><p>Doing without Scrapbook is not an option, but on the other hand, neither is surfing the web with what will soon be an outdated browser riddled with security flaws.
</p><p>For this reason, I decided to try a workaround that I read about some time ago: installing the 32-bit version of Firefox 52 ESR alongside the latest 64-bit version of the browser side-by-side, and using a different user profile for each. The idea was to use the up-to-date version of the browser for normal surfing, and to revert to the old version whenever it was necessary to use scrapbook.
</p><p>Well, at least it sounded good on paper. In practice I'm finding that using two different user profiles is by no means a guarantee that the two Firefox instances won't interfere with each other. I create a bookmark on the bookmarks toolbar in one instance; it shows up in the other instance. I delete it in one instance; it disappears in the other. Not even using the command line options -P ""Profile Name""  or -no-remote are helping.
</p><p>I really need to find a solution for this and any help would be greatly appreciated. Here are my questions summarized:
</p><p>1) Is there an alternative to Scrapbook that provides at least 90% of the same functionality? 
</p><p>2) Is there a way to have two versions of Firefox installed - 52 ESR 32-bit AND whatever the latest and greatest 64-bit is - and keep them completely separate from each other?
</p><p>3) Is there something else I'm missing?
</p><p>Thanks!

</p><p>I know this is like a broken record, but I'm to a point where I'm about to give upon Firefox after all these years...
</p><p>After the last problem, reported here under two (2) entries - lost all favicons in the upgrades from 60 to 61, got to a point where I couldn't even delete any bookmarks, so I uninstalled Firefox completely, every trace, including bookmarks.
</p><p>I have had no desktop version of Firefox for sometime now, but did keep Portable Firefox updated, including bookmarks.
</p><p>I downloaded a fresh install of Firefox 62 this week, no issues setting it up, imported the HTML bookmark export file from Portable Firefox, no issues.
</p><p>Since the problems in 60 and 61, I now approach my bookmarks differently, I removed almost 3000 business bookmarks and now have them in a Word file, kept about 1000 active in FF.
</p><p>When I set up FF62 and imported from file, all my favicons were there in both sandboxed and unsandboxed Firefox (I use Sandboxie).
</p><p>Booted up this morning, all favicons are gone again, every single one of them.
</p><p>I have no issues with bookmark favicons in Portable Firefox, Slimjet (Chrome) or Waterfox - they all have identical counts and all favicons are present - just desktop Firefox and just since FF60.
</p><p>I have no issues with any of those browsers either sandboxed or unsandboxed either.
</p><p>I started with a completely fresh install, new profile, no bookmarks. When I downloaded and set up FF62, everything was great - I set up FF in an unsandboxed environment, always do.
</p><p>Portable Firefox, Portable Thunderbird and Thunderbird run flawlessly, I don't get it.

Nowhere is the cause specified. There are no details of what behaviour or code on the site caused it to be listed, or who listed it, or why. Just a big message saying that this is a Deceptive Site. There's no one I can talk to about this, no way to find out any information whatsoever - there's not even any notification that the site has been blocked. All of which makes it just about impossible to actually FIX whatever is causing this issue (assuming that there is one, and I haven't just been reported randomly by some troll).
</p><p>So, to sum up: there's no useful information, no transparency and no accountability anywhere in this process. Just Google throwing their weight around and you letting them.
</p><p>I'm not saying that there is no problem - there may be a legitimate issue that needs addressing. What I'm saying is that the way the Mozilla Foundation has dealt with the problem makes it more or less impossible to actually do that addressing. Who exactly does that help?

So whatever is going on in the background has to be involved with why this is happening. The FF interface by the way had been closed for about 20 minutes before I got the crash notice. This is not about running MBAM,buying a new machine or upgrading to the ESR. to fix the problem. It's academic. i want to know why because all the recommendations to upgrade in the past have not improved the situation and recent upgrades made things worse. I will be doing the ESR upgrade in time but I want to be able to launch this version as well perhaps as a different user.

These are root certificates which you've manually imported.  If you understood that last sentence, then it means you've probably done it on your computer; I know I have.  The steps to fix it are these, and I cite the original web page further below:
</p><p>- Open a new window in Firefox and type ""about:config"" without the quotes and hit enter
- Confirm that you want to continue
- In the search field, type in security.enterprise_roots.enabled and hit enter - you'll be left with one field
- If it's marked as ""false"" then double-clicking it should turn it to ""true""
- Close the window, then go back to your Yahoo email login and try again.  For me, this worked *perfectly*!
</p><p>Here's the site where I found the info, under the ""Experimental Built-in Windows Support"" section:

1232767,1536374277,"How can I recognize profile files and restore bookmarks, logins and prefs in a new installation of Firefox?","<p>I recently used App Cleaner and Uninstaller to delete an extra copy of Firefox on my MacBook Pro. The duplicate application file was already named Firefox2 and I selected that along with it's service files and user profiles, etc. to be deleted. To my surprise, both copies were deleted and I had enabled the deletion to bypass the trash directory. I'm also still kicking myself for failing to make an image of my hard drive prior to the deletion. I used several 3rd party apps to try restoring the files as I'm interested in the stored passwords and the bookmarks. Not an easy task and not practical.
</p><p>One of my data recovery apps found a copy of bookmarks that I had exported a while back as well as a few folders with a collection of what seems to be user application support files. I'm not sure, but I think they are profiles. There are several folders (although I'm the only user of this computer) each named with an 8-character alphanumeric name followed by the file extension of ""default-"" plus a 13 digit number. 
</p><p>Among the contents of each are numerous file, folders and subfolders with names that include: add-ons, bookmarks, cookies, extensions, logins, perfs, sesssionstore, signon, webapps, etc.  Assuming that theses are the profiles, how can restore them? 
</p><p>In addition, I also found several folder with names such as ""0120B2F92360F7C11C4B3CFAC56B25F1B8FA2303C8"" containing one file with names such as ""E71086F8-C7A8-4D60-9C49-7F291855FE17.01f61a19376cb7ec511b721ea5737760f85b218462"".

</p><p>Two of those files appear to be interesting:
</p><pre>    com.apple.backupd.filechecklist
    System.keychain-orig

<p>I don't know if these are useful or not.

</p><p>maybe some more precisions:
</p><p>- win7 x64, with FF x64
</p><p>- the ""crashed"" profile has only been opened, not yet closed (I use hibernate so it wont be closed till I have an answer)
</p><p>- I use multiple profiles at once, and the update occured while opening a new profile AND running 2 other profiles
</p><p>- in ""sessionstore-backups"", I only have 2 files, ""recovery.baklz4"" and ""recovery.jsonlz4"", all with a ""Date modified"" AFTER the date of the upgrade
</p><p>- the settings of the ""crashed"" profile are as follow: ""restore old session -&gt; checked"", BUT, ""Clear history when Firefox closes has ALL checkboxes checked"".
</p><p><br>
This is the first time i encounter this bug since Quantum got out. With previous FF, there has ALWAYS been backup files.
I tried an undelete software, but it found NO deleted files in this folder, so I guess the files have been overwritten ...
</p><p><br>
I had like 29 tabs opened, and before this update, the restore session thing was perfectly working.
When the profile opened after the update, there was one page only, the one advertising about pocket (so ironic ^^).
</p><p><br>
What are my chances to recover my tabs ?
</p><p><br>
Bonus questions:
</p><p>- gnnn, why the lz4 thing on session files ? What soft should i use to get a FULL text version ? 7zip wont take it as an archive.
</p><p>- i'm on quantum right now but i'm fed up, it has been disappointments only. I'm using FF since v2 (15+ years), and it's like they killed my browser (apart from the perfs, i only LOST functionnalities). So, back to ESR very quickly, but is that a long-term solution (do not consider security, only websites compatibility) ?
</p><p>- Can i install ESR and quantum in parallel ? Are the profiles retro-compatible/cross-compatible ? I have 29 profiles, but not all of them have seen Quantum yet, so maybe I'm lucky.

1232816,1536414199,Toolbar in preview window ESR version 60.2 is missing.,"<p>Foxit Reader is my favourite PDF program. To be able to save and print from the preview window in Firefox (on the left hand upper side) I use the ESR channel. Till version 59.9 at the bottom of the preview window  a toolbar appeared with which I could save or print the document. Since the upgrade to version 60.2, this toolbar does not appear (which was the fact when I used the standard version of Firefox). I want to downgrade to ESR 59.9 (though Mozilla does not recommend this) in order to have back the toolbar, but if I choose for this version (in the download history under 'options') the latest version remains. Secondly: Is there a way to retrieve the mentioned toolbar in ESR version 60.2?

1232837,1536419041,Why should the Description Field be removed from Bookmarks?,"<p>Notice I didn't ask why IS it being removed.  That's already been explained, and there appears to be virtually zero support among users for the removal of this feature.  I have log-in information for almost a hundred websites stored in the Description Field in Bookmarks.  I've been reading that many others do as well.  Please understand that I appreciate volunteers taking the time to help users.  That's why I first read the Bugzilla report on this ""bug"" but I could find no evidence of how this solution doesn't cause more harm than good.  One reason for the feature's removal is that the extra coding needed to generate the Description Field is somehow burdensome on FireFox's efficiency.  No evidence is given for this, although I don't doubt it may reduce efficiency by an imperceptible amount.  Another claim is that very few people are taking advantage of the feature, while in the same breath admitting there was no way to actually know this!  
</p><p>I've used FireFox since its inception, and this is the first time I've felt compelled to find the secret handshake that takes me to the registration page so I could ask for support.  I understood when, for example, Quantum broke my ""DownThemAll!"" extension.  However, removing the Description Field feature appears to be a solution in search of a problem.

1232888,1536431738,Is there a replacement in Firefox ESR 60.2 for the leagacy add-on Backward/Forward History Dropdown that allowed you to left-click to view recent history,"<p>I just upgraded from Firefox ESR 52.9 to ESR 60.2.  The upgrade has made my legacy add-on ""Backward/Forward History Dropdown"" dysfunctional.  That add-on displayed a dropdown arrow to the left of the location bar that listed the websites in the same window that I visited in the current browsing session, and enabled me to select a website in the list that I wanted to return to.  (That obviously was much easier than using the Back button to return to recently visited websites one by one.)  The only ways to do that now appear to be to pull down or right-click on the backward or forward indicators, but since I use an old trackpad it would be much more convenient to tap on a dropdown arrow as I used to do.
</p><p>After doing a bit of online research I created a chrome folder in my profile and then 3 subfolders named config, css, and image, along with 2 files called userChrome.css and userContent.css.  I then followed the instructions in this website:
</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/releases</a>
</p><p>I clicked on custom_css_for_fx_v2.0.5.zip and copied the contents of the folders and files into the ones in my chrome folder, except that I copied only one command from the userChrome.css file that looked like it might relate to my issue.  In addition, I copied some script I found elsewhere that made my tab toolbar disappear, since I don't use tabs.  My tab toolbar has disappeared as I wanted, but my backward/forward buttons haven't changed at all and still don't show a dropdown history marker.  The contents of my userChrome.css file are as follows:
</p>
<pre>#tabbrowser-tabs {
visibility: collapse !important;
}

/* other button settings ************************************************************************/
/* @import ""./css/buttons/forward_button_hide_when_disabled.css""; /**/
@import ""./css/buttons/back_and_forward_separated_history_popups.css""; /**/
/* @import ""./css/buttons/back_and_forward_leftclick_history_popup_hidden.css""; /**/</pre>
<p>Am I doing something wrong in the way I imported the script , or is the script not intended to do what I want?  If the latter, are you working on a replacement for the legacy add-on that will be compatible with Firefox Quantum?
</p><p>FYI, I'm using Windows 7. 64 bit.

1232914,1536447006,Change scrollbars Tor Browser 8 (Fx 60.2.0ESR) _userChrome still work?,"<p>Tor Browser 8.0_Linux x64 (uses Firefox 60.2.0esr) made a lot of changes to scrollbars &amp; a few other UI objects.
TBB 8.0 doesn't pick up the active Linux theme elements.  I'm not sure if it ever did, but some things in v8.0 don't suit my needs.  I'm wondering why it doesn't pick up the system theme.
</p><p>Regular Linux Firefox 60.1.0ESR uses the system theme - either native ones from the distro, or custom themes.
So it appears it's NOT just because the theme(s) contain code that Fx Quantum can't use.  Right off, I don't see anything that regular Fx 60.1 ESR isn't using from the active system theme.  
</p><p>AFAIK, there is no change for namespace lines in CSS files from before and after Fx 57.
I made no changes to the system theme after installing Fx 60.1ESR, to make it work.
Apparently, no one on the official Tor  mailing list has any ideas why TBB wouldn't use the system theme.  
</p><p>TBB 8 / Fx 60.2.0 ESR has a /Browser/gtk2/<a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file, that appears to control some of the UI, <b>but so does regular Fx 60.1 ESR, </b>and it doesn't ignore the system theme.  The TBB  <a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file is larger than the version in regular Fx.
</p><p>Nothing  jumped out for differences in about:config, searching ""theme"" between the TBB version vs. the version from Mozilla.
</p><p>2) Besides TBB 8.0 ignoring the system theme &amp; so far not using code from userChrome that worked in Linux in all regular Fx versions &lt; 57,  Frank Lion says most of old UI css code for pre Firefox 57 will still work for Fx 57+, but some may not.  Again, Firefox 60.1esr (linux) just uses the system theme - including customized scrollbars &amp; sliders.  
The(clean) profile for Fx 60.1esr has no userChrome.css file.  
</p><p>But Fx 60.1esr DOES have a /gtk2/<a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file and <b>still uses the system theme.</b> If I wanted to further customize objects in regular Fx 57+, I COULD add a userChrome.css, as I did pre-v57.   Generally, I didn't have problems customizing say, scrollbars, using userChrome.css, even though the system theme also had custom code for scrollbars.

1233066,1536544919,YouTube Default view ON FIREFOX is changed so it's practically the same as Theater mode.  How do I get the old default view back?,"<p>YouTube Default view used to show the video on the left, with the Up Next thumbnails in a column on the right.  (If a playlist was selected, it would appear at the head of the right-hand column with the Up Next thumbnails below it.)  Comments appeared below the video.  
On three other browsers (Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi) YouTube Default view remains the same as before, but ON FIREFOX it's changed to something quite different.  In the new Default view the video stretches horizontally all the way across the screen.  The height is increased proportionately, and on my laptop that means that the video won't fit on the screen heightwise -- what a nuisance, I have to scroll to see the upper and lower parts of the video image: I can't see the whole thing a once. The contents of the (old view) right-hand column now appear below the video, and Comments appear below that.  To get to Comments I have to scroll, scroll, scroll.  It is an ungainly and  confusing layout.
Peculiarly, the new Default view layout is practically the same as the Theater mode.  Th only difference I see is that in the new Default view the panel above the video has a white background, whereas the in the Theater mode that panel has a black background.  Now there's a useful feature!
I never had any use for YouTube Theater mode. I would use either the (old, user-friendly) Default view or Full Screen.  Why duplicate Theater mode features and then replace Default view with them?
</p><p>I assume that this is a Firefox problem because the old Default view still appears on other browsers. I want  it back on FIREFOX!  How do I do it?

Теперь если мы нажмем кнопку развернуть видео на весь экран, а потом выйти из полноэкранного режима, то активная вкладка не останется на своем бывшем месте т.е. по середине ленты, а будет отображаться в крайнем правом углу лены вкладок.

I clicked email but the next screen gave me no more information about what POCKET was so I backed out and opened another window with my HOMEPAGE.

1233159,1536598112,Not able to recover previous session after Firefox update and crash,"<p>Hello,
my problem is as follows:
</p><p>I had a session open when i updated Firefox. It closed the browser however Firefox didn't show me any indication that it was updating so i tried open it again. Right that moment the update window showed up and somehow Firefox crashed. 
When i opened it again, my previous session was lost and i have no way of retrieving it. There is no option popping up in the menu that says 'Restore Session' and other methods that i have seen online are a bit difficult to understand.
</p><p>Also the sessions i can recover are all after Firefox kinda crashed/Firefox updated so i don't know how to get my old session back.
The session i want to recover is before i updated to Firefox 62.0 on the 10th, September. (Time stamp would be around 5:30pm CEST)
</p><p>Oh and i have seen this thread (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1204253"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1204253</a>) and i tried doing it, but the session i want back is not there.... does that mean worst case scenario happened and i won't be able to get my session back? ;____;
</p><p><br>
This may be a dumb question but would reseting my windows version to 9th, September help? I mean it would erase the update i did for Firefox and should (as much as i know &lt;.&lt;) also reset the setting for Firefox to yesterday's ones correct?
But would that help since my problem is on the net surface and not a computer problem &gt;.&gt;
</p><p><br>
ps: i wanted to upload pictures but it somehow doesn't let me, so if you need them, please tell me and i will try to send them.

My preferences and settings have been changed, such as restoring previous session when starting and auto scrolling options. 
It is also incredibly slow. Even a simple web page such as Google, for which I have cookies, now takes nearly 20 seconds to load! A more complex web page including images and videos doesnt stand a chance and wont load at all. It just tries to load forever and never gets there. 
In the last day it has gotten too slow and I have downloaded chrome to use. If FireFox doesnt speed up and get fixed within the next week I will have to make Chrome my default browser and get rid of FireFox. 
Is there a fix for this coming ASAP or are we now stuck with a browser that wont browse? And with the next update can we keep our own preferences instead of having random boxes checked and unchecked?

</p><p>1. A financial website, where documents have been uploaded for me to esign. I click to open the documents and just get an empty page. I was able to open and esign them in Chrome. I have opened secure documents on that site before and didn't have a problem but it may have been my first time using the esign function.
</p><p>2. On my pet pharmacy website, <a href=""https://ccpet.vetsfirstchoice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ccpet.vetsfirstchoice.com/</a>, I click on buttons/menus that don't open the page they're supposed to open. For example, Sign In. Shop the Sale. and so on. The URL does appear at the bottom of my window but nothing else happens and it doesn't show me the ""working"" animation that I get when something is loading slowly.
</p><p>I can hover over the links and open them in a new tab, but then on the new tab some links don't work and so on. It all works fine in Chrome.
</p><p>None of this has happened before, I haven't added anything new, just the regular Firefox updates. I am on a Windows 10 computer and Firefox version 62.0

1233398,1536708411,Something starts happening after two hours or so on Firefox - WHAT IS IT?,"<p>For over a year now, I have experienced the 'phenomenon' that after between two and three hours of browsing, the whole of Firefox just grinds to a halt.  I have tried all the various suggestions but nothing works.
</p><p>I have a large number of tabs, because they are all regularly used in my family history research,  I am moving between web sites all the time to gain information, capture screen shots from Trove, and update data on Ancestry and MyHeritage, particularly,  I am also switching to other programs regularly, e.g. Photoshop Elements, Excel and Word.
</p><p>As a retired programmer, and amateur web site developer, I am wondering whether the browser is doing some activity such as indexing across all tabs, or refreshing of all tabs, after two hours - if so I am seeking some way  to disable this activity, which I don't want to happen, because it is just annoying and wasting precious time in a life timetable which is rapidly coming near to its end.
</p><p>Along similar lines of frustration I am also experiencing that if I leave the browser open and go away to have a meal (for maybe 1 to 2 hours or even sometimes as little as 10 to 15 minutes) it is nearly never possible to get Firefox to just start up again when I go to access a tab in the session that I left open.  Very often Firefox crashes in such situations, while on other occasions it just takes maybe as much as half an hour for it to get back up to pace, so to say. 
</p><p>Again - Is Firefox doing some background tasks?  I do not want Firefox to do any background tasks of ANY KIND.  I simply want a browser that shows me the page when I request it and then leaves it alone, no automatic refreshing, no indexing, no nothing -  simple page display.  I only want refreshing when I ask for it.
</p><p>Finally, this last point is maybe Firefox related, maybe Ancestry related, maybe OS related, I am not sure, but again it is something to do with Firefox not doing the basics, but seemingly doing lots of other things that I do not want it to do.  Often when I add information to a record that is open on a tab in Ancestry, the re-display of the tab, with the updated information, does not come back up with its proper name, e.g. ""Philip Mark Hunt"", instead it just comes up as ""Ancestry Person"".  It is as though the reloading of the tab has hit some kind of timeout, so it just defaults to a general name rather than the true tab name.

I log in manually repeatedly, and I'm not offered to save it, and It isn't found in ""Saved Logins"". I'd sure like to have Firefox remember that login. How can I do that? It is my understanding that a website can be set up to NOT let the browser login saving work. Maybe that's what's going on here? But is there some way to force that login to be saved?

1233412,1536720460,Addons / Extensions / Plugins Safety,"<p>I have always been a firm believer in an addon-free life. I avoid third-party addons like the plague because I've always been paranoid of their capabilities of stealing data and sharing sensitive information.
</p><p>But I'm starting to really get tired of ads, and after looking at some plugins available, I've decided I need to make certain aspects of my browser easier to use. OneTab for example is looking like something that would reduce a lot of headache in my life.
</p><p>I decided to check up on Mozilla and their advice regarding addon safety, and came across this page:
<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/01/understanding-extension-permission-requests/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/01/understanding-extension-permission-requests/</a>
</p><p>and on that page, I came across this part of the article:
</p>
<hr>
<p>How do I stay safe?
While there is an element of risk to installing any third-party software, there are a few simple best practices you can follow to reduce it. Is the extension made by a reputable developer? Are the user ratings high? Are the permission requests consistent with the features of the extension?
</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a bone to pick with this guideline or, ""best practice"".
</p><p>Is the extension made by a reputable developer? Are the user ratings high?
</p><p>First of all, does the fact that a reputable developer made the addon have any bearing on whether the addon is safe?
</p><p>And second of all, the reputation of the developer is directly influenced by the user-ratings a developer's addon/s receive.
</p><p>Google and Facebook are both majorly reputable companies, and they sell your data like Lemonade on a summer's day.
</p><p>More importantly, user-ratings are only an indication of how well the advertised functions of the addon work. And I bet any addon developer who is developing an addon to do dirty work in the background, is definitely going to make sure that the advertised functions of the addon are in proper working order.
</p><p>Another issue here is that, user-ratings consist primarily of users....The average Joe, not by security researchers, or even developers/coders. Does the average Joe really leave a user rating behind based on how safe he thinks the addon is?
</p><p>Just a thought. Telling people that a ""best practice"" for determining the safety of an addon should factor in the user-rating seems a little misleading.
</p><p>Regardless though, can Firefox not have a function that tells you what kind of info an addon is passing over the internet?
</p><p>Thanks.

</p><p>A lot of times, I will accidentally 'blow-up' the browser to full-screen size while moving the mouse around, equal to intentionally hitting the 'green' traffic light circled button, or using the Firefox pull-down menu 'WINDOW &gt; ZOOM.'  
</p><p>This is a hassle in Mac when done accidentally, because then I have to make the tom menu bar appear by swiping down and up, then manually drag the corner of the active window to reduce the window size.  It also upsets my pre-set, preferred size of the window (critical for professional film/tv editors who usually work on dual, 24 to 30-inch screens; where a full Firefox window is way too big for e-mails, surfing the web, and other tasks).
</p><p>I can't believe there is no ""Un-zoom"" keystroke (way easier than mousing to a pull-down menu) to return the Firefox window to the size I had set it to!

1233458,1536754463,Why does moving bookmarks within the bookmarks toolbar folders automatically open a link when I drop the bookmark?,"<p>This is incredibly annoying, and I'd like to know if there is some sort of workaround for this.
</p><p>Basically, go to your bookmarks toolbar, and create a folder. Then, add some bookmarks to it. Then, move your bookmarks around within that folder, reordering them. Every time to you try reorder, it opens links randomly. ie every time you move a bookmark within the folder by holding them mouse click on it and then dragging it, when you release the click and drop it in the new location, basically, a new page is opened.

1233469,1536759303,The menu does not have a Restore previous session tab.,"<p>I left the tab open and shut down the computer and log on again, but the tabs disappeared, and when I close the tabs at once, the button to restore the previous session comes out as soon as I turn on Firefox. So I tried to try to find out how to restore the previous session, search for it and let Mozilla know how to do it, but it does not fit my Firefox. I'm up-to-date but I do not know if the version is different. This is because there is no version in the explanation. First of all, if you click on the menu, you can not see the tab for restoring the previous session. Also, when the session is restored, there is no match for my case, and there is no last window and tab view when launching Firefox in the General panel in Settings. Once I have found all the fixes in my Firefox configuration, I have checked the old panel under the start page in the General panel, and I left it in my history. Cookies and site data are also available until the expiration date. No, it was already there.
But the tabs disappeared. As a result of my thought, I deleted the entire visit record in the morning. I've kept tabs on Firefox ever since. But I do not think it would be a problem if I deleted my records. This is because the closed tabs are recorded as soon as the tabs are closed even if the history is deleted. I've looked into the add-on to see if there are apps that revert closed tabs, but nothing I thought of.
What I'm saying is that Mozilla support is different from the latest version of Firefox. Therefore, other users are uncomfortable and uncomfortable.
Also, I want to know why the closed tabs did not reopen as I said so far.
And how do I know if I can revert closed tabs back to normal?
I have a long question, but please answer it in detail. I do not know how to speak English. There may be awkward sentences, but I hope you understand. request.

</p><p>I have 10 PCs here. We are using 55.0.3 because it was the last version with a UI that we were all familiar with, worked with all the services we use, supported all the add-ons and more. It's very outdated but I want to keep all PCs on a known working environment. 
</p><p>So I'm currently testing 61.0.2 (Not 62.0 because it's a zero release, which always have issues). I've managed to find solutions for most annoyances regarding add ons and using  Photon-Australis to get back the curved tabs (The square look is just plain disgusting). I've got the reload icon back in the address bar, and hidden the 3 dots with a 30 second timeout so I will likely never have to be annoyed by it. I've got rid of the wasted spaces on the address bar too.
</p><p>I use a space theme (Earth from space). It uses a cyan font. On the white tabs it's all but invisible. Using the dark theme fixes that, but I'd like to have the tabs the same color as the background of the address bar as in v55. Reading through the userchrome.css file I just get lost. 
</p><p>The other thing I'd like to preserve are the icons for home, download and bookmarks, Is there a way to preserve the icons that are used in v55 rather than the uglier ones use in v61?
</p><p>I'm sorry for coming across so negatively, it' just I don't get why developers keep changing UIs that are working. Change for the sake of change, which just adds frustration. Firefox is not the only program. Windows is probably the worst. So please don't be offended.

1233755,1536904783,Firefox does not allow saving the history! Where is this anchored? other tips?,"<p>Hello everybody,
</p><p>as already described, my chronicle was suddenly gone (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1231311)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1231311)</a>.
Now I'm the cause of the glue gone and have found that the company computer since the last update prevents. This is a pity, of course, and I have also reported that to IT, they have switched to my computer, etc. and tried to correct this. I quickly realized that they have no real idea about their job. Firefox has been reinstalled several times, other versions and and ..
Current status, I have to live with the fact that my chronicle is not there after a reboot, or I have to work with FF 53. This is just installed, but does not accept my 4500 bookmarks created with FF 62.
Now I have FF 62 Portable installed on a stick on my home computer, set up with FF sync, etc., then plugged it into the company computer and it happens the same as when I install the browser locally.
There is no history saved after quitting or working with FF Sync. Everything is grayed out in the settings.
My approach would be that I in the registry or wherever the values change so I get full access back to my FF settings. Can someone tell me what and where to change this? Or. Where this is stored?
Or can someone give me other tips on how I could get on?

I got 20 over folder in ""AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\"" at this point. after several time relaunching FF.
I reckon it is because of my SSD.
</p><p>So the solution was, 
-uninstall firefox.
-run check disk error checking. 
-the windows do its thing, restarting and ruck chckdsk. let it finish checking and repairing,
-delete profiles.ini and all the profiles folder. 
-restart to give a fresh start. just in case

1233828,1536939799,Pocket search as search engine? And how to add search engine from anywhere?,"<p>Hello. I love search engines with keywords, I have many and they are very useful (""gten"" translates whatever I type next in the URL bar  to English in Google Translate, ""lenes"" does the same from English to Spanish in Linguee, ""denes"" the same in DeepL, ""fa"" looks for Firefox add-ons, ""gd"" opens any document('s URL) in Google Docs, and so on). So I have two questions:
</p><p>1) How can I add a search engine from any search box anywhere as I could with ""Add to Search Bar"" (a legacy add-on, ""add-to-searchbox@maltekraus.de"")?
</p><p>The ""find replacement"" link (<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/find-replacement/?guid=add-to-searchbox@maltekraus.de"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/find-replacement/?guid=add-to-searchbox@maltekraus.de</a>) shows nothing of value, absolutely nothing.
</p><p>I managed to find Search Engine Helper (<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-engines-helper/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-engines-helper/</a> &amp; <a href=""https://github.com/soufianesakhi/firefox-search-engines-helper)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/soufianesakhi/firefox-search-engines-helper)</a>, which requires manual input of search URL pattern etc., but does not provide an equivalent usability level to the legacy one's (maybe due to never ending API limitations).
</p><p>2) How can I have a search engine for Pocket?
</p><p>Pocket and Firefox are both under Mozilla's umbrella and it should be easy to integrate them. Yet, if I not mistaken (as I am tech savvy only to a point), Pocket search seems to be based on a GET command, according to my amateur analysis of developer tools' network requests, instead of a direct <a href=""http://getpocket.com/a/queue/list/%s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getpocket.com/a/queue/list/%s</a> (this is the URL for opening a tag directly).

It does it for ""Qwant"", ""Amazon"" and ""Wikipedia"" (and maybe others), but not for ""Duckduckgo"", ""Google"" and ""Debian Packages"" (and maybe others).
The behaviour is similar if I reset my profile (I mean a new one).
</p><p>I also noticed that I can't remove some search engines, like ""Ebay"" or ""Portail Lexical - CNRTL"", even with a new profile. Every time I restart Firefox, they reappear.

In such organizations, the latest firefox would be obtained once, checked out, then rolled out to the organization from it's support system team/person.

1233931,1537029756,Bookmarks and folders  in Firefox 62,"<p>I have found the bookmark feature much different when I went to Firefox 62.0.  Maybe it happen earlier, but that is when I noticed.  The old method was much more intuitive.  I have figured out the new method by clicking on choose which then opened up my folders , but why change something that has been in place for decades?  People are use to seeing their folders without clicking on choose.  Now I will get a half dozen others asking me about bookmarks.   I would at least thought somewhere there was a fact sheet with warning of basic operational changes without a whole lot of detail technical jargon that most users wouldn't understand or care about.  Then what purpose did that change make to the overall functionally?   If none, it shouldn't have been made.

</p><p>I'm pretty new to all this, but I decided I'd give themes a go anyway.

I was wondering if I could, say, have the currently selected tab and the url bar red and the other tabs and background grey, or something of a similar sort? This might be plainly obvious and I'm just asking a stupid question, but I've read through some of the articles on themes at <a href=""http://developer.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">developer.mozilla.org</a> as well as looking at the tabs api, in case that had anything, but I still can't see anything that explains anything like what I'm wanting.

Also I would like to know this about the nature of the Sync options:
If I tick the ""Bookmarks"" in the Sync options, it takes that user's bookmarks and pushes them into the sharing process, correct? Does the selection affect what is Synced INTO the current user?  As in does the selection work as a simultaneous push/pull for the bookmark data or is just one or the other? The direction of sync isn't really clear on the options.

Right now, upon reaching about 4-5GB of memory usage, my JS console window reports an our of memory error and dumps my code. I appreciate that this is pretty normal behavior, as 4GB of memory is fairly outlandish for a website. However, for the use case of VR, particularly in physics engine development, it can feel a bit restrictive and even silly when I have 32GB sitting idle - and I could readily double that to 64. However, I know Firefox has a rather extensive about:config section - and I was wondering if anyone knew if one of these variables allowed us to override the internal limits of the browsers memory limitations?

1234118,1537162809,How to get the custom search engine with keywords (similar to that of Google Chrome) in firefox?,"<p>When will we be getting the custom search engine feature in firefox that is on par with chrome and doesn't require me to write an addon. This is really helpful in the cases when the url is not that of a search engine, but requires lots of mundane and repeated url constructions - e.g.
1. https://&lt;SomeCodeBrowserSite&gt;.com/packages/%s/logs, https://&lt;SomeCodeBrowserSite&gt;.com/packages/%s/releases or https://&lt;SomeCodeBrowserSite&gt;.com/packages/%s/repo-info etc. while, there is a separate search engine with url - https://&lt;SomeCodeBrowserSite&gt;.com/search?term=&lt;search term&gt; 
2. And each of the %s will be replaced with the string that is typed in the location bar - in the above example, the first url can be constructed 
</p><pre>a. by typing ""cbp"" in the location bar and
b. space or tab
c. &lt;the actual package name&gt;
d. press enter
e. boom!! you see the url expands and substitutes the string and the page is being loaded.
Search requires 2 hops, while i could directly end up on the page in a single step without the requirement of navigating the search results.
</pre>
<p>3. In addition, it doesn't require to have a string field that needs to be substituted. for example, i have set ""cse"" for chrome://settings and as soon as i type ""cse"" and press enter, the settings page loads.
</p><p>As a software developer, i have around 50+ such urls each tagged with specific shortcuts and this is the only thing that stops me from moving back to firefox - (desperately waiting to move to firefox given the ram consumption by chrome - but not until these 50 urls are migrated).

I can't access my new website's cPanel login page using Firefox  62.0 because it 'times out' when I have my VPN service active.
I have a Windows 10 PC and  can access the cPanel login page using Chrome and IE with the VPN active. I can also access it from my iPhone.
What would be stopping Firefox from accessing it? I have cleared the cache and allowed it in my firewall settings so an at a loss why.

</p><p>Open all in tabs
New Bookmark
New folder
New separator
Cut
Copy
Delete
Sort by name
Properties
</p><p>I cannot see which would drag them all out nor can I use left click (showing them all) then right to drag them all out!

1234282,1537252359,Firefox 28 no longer seems to play well with Youtube. Is there a fix?,"<p>Hey all.
</p><p>As some of you may know from some older questions, I have two machines. One a Windows XP desktop running Firefox 28, as it was the last version I knew that supported Windows XP, and the other a Windows 10 Laptop that is on the current version of Firefox.
</p><p>Sadly, my post is about the XP version of Firefox tonight. Please don't judge. The computer still runs, so I haven't seen a reason to get rid of it, and I split my time between the two machines.
</p><p>I'll get right to the point. Up till tonight, Version 28 on Windows XP had worked perfectly with Youtube— Or at least as near to it as the old machine could get— as it typically played every video more or less with no issues via the HTML5 video player that Youtube supposedly uses. However tonight, I have been getting very hit or miss responses on youtube, as the HTML5 player does not always come up, and when it does not, I get an image of static with text saying that my browser is not recognizing any of the available formats. When I check <a href=""http://youtube.com/html5"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/html5</a>, it is showing that it recognizes some of the formats— apparently only two so far, and HTML5 itself isn't even listed among them, though there is a checked box saying that the HTML5 player is used when possible— so I'm just wondering, what the hell happened here? As I said, Up till basically last night, everything worked more or less fine on Youtube, with there being only a handful of times the issue of a video format not being recognized came up. In fact Firefox 28 is still somehow pulling up the classic version of youtube, rather than the new version, which I have no explanation for. 
</p><p>Did Youtube stop supporting HTML5 in favor of a new video format, or is something else going on here? 
</p><p>If there is a later version of Firefox that still worked for Windows XP ( I think I remember someone suggesting that 43 would work, but half of the extensions no longer seem to exist for it that I use, including classic theme restorer— though I think someone at waterfox said they may have archived that extension, however I have no idea how to access or use archived extensions— but any port in a storm at this stage) that supports whatever Youtube is using, that would be welcome information, despite my attachment to version 28. Hell, if I could make sense out of how to set up multiple profiles for Firefox, I'd run the classic 28 and whatever later version might run with whatever Youtube is doing so I wouldn't have to give up my preferred version on this old machine. Again though, sometimes the HTML5 player works, and sometimes it doesn't. So I dunno what the issue is here and if there's a fix I can find for Firefox 28, as it is the last version I knew worked for the older machine. 
</p><p>Thankfully, this issue doesn't come up on the Windows 10 laptop, so this is not repeating itself there, Thankfully. But is there a way to fix this, or am I just stuck with considering Youtube a partial, if not complete loss on the XP machine? It's one of only three sites I even still use the browser for. The other two being <a href=""http://fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">fanfiction.net</a> and <a href=""http://wikipedia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia.org</a>
</p><p>And if there IS a later version of Firefox that still actually works with XP, does anyone have a basic 'here's how even an idiot can fix it so you can run two versions on the same machine' explanation of how to set that up? I am NOT a technical person, and going into excessive detail does me no favors. I just need simple, point by point instructions that are, in effect such that a three year old could read and understand them if there is a way to have two versions of the program running. 
</p><p>Though this does also make me wonder if I can install the browser in my second internal hard drive rather than the primary C drive and still have it work properly.
</p><p>Anyway, sorry for the rambling. If anyone could help me address these issues, that would be much appreciated. :)

1234292,1537262349,How to stop firefox ESR 52 from autoupdating?,"<p>NOTE: This forum is quite bogus as it doesn't allow me to register just to reply to existing threads. So now you get yet another question for this topic that you're dodging all time, mozilla. Why are you behaving LAME like the rest of the internet?
Now the actual issue. I am using Firefox 52 ESR due to the horrible npapi plugin for java. I am completely aware of all the security issues and so are my users. We are waiting for the developers to use something else than java. I run a Linux environment and I cannot run either Explorer or Safari. Recently Firefox ESR 52 started updating for no reason, even with updater disabled.
</p><p>I resolved by removing the updater binary and the updater.ini files in the Firefox ESR distribution. At least it seems it's not doing it automatically anymore. We will see how it works, since developers are behaving like apple developers in this forum, instead of disclosing technology they hide it. That S U C K S!

1234376,1537303306,remove synced data from cloud while configured to use local sync server,"<p>We use a firefox sync server locally for around 50 users. One server updated automatically and lost the custom value for the ""identity.sync.tokenserver.uri"" setting in about:config.

What is the process to clear and remove all the synced data from the cloud sync server for several users without removing the local sync server's contents as well?
</p><p>The issue here is technically how it is done. If I reset an account's password, and then change it from my laptop which is set to use the local sync server, from what I can tell that would remove the contents from the local sync server rather than the cloud one, or would it do both somehow? Then there is the question of if I change the password while on that server, choose a new one, it will then start syncing to the cloud sync server again right?

</p><p>I have been copying the more recent ""recovery.jsonlz4"" to my Data drive before deleting it from ""sessionstore-backups"" - could that be causing the problem? It's in the Recycle Bin too. I'm just reluctant to delete it entirely.
</p><p>In short: Why does Firefox keep restoring a session I've deleted? How can I make it restore the older upgrade file?

Also when scrolling down I get a yellow bar at the top saying a page is causing the browser to not load even if it is the page that I am on, and asks if I want to stop or abort. Does not really matter how many tabs are open but more tabs increase the problems, and windows is most likely part of the problem as the limited connectivity is insane, even with the signal at maximum, and when going to the command prompt and pinging various sites there is no problem.

</p><p>I am looking to download the Firefox 52 ESR (at least I believe it's supposed to be 52, I dunno if it's 52.0 or one of the later builds) which is said to still work with Windows XP, in the hopes of getting Youtube working again as version 28 works fine on everything BUT that as mentioned here:   <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1234282"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1234282</a> , however I am extremely pressed for space on the Primary drive marked C:, which has me worried about downloading and installing a new version onto my primary internal hard drive. However I have two internal hard drives, C and W. Can the ESR be loaded onto a different internal drive (i.e. the W drive), and if so, will it be considered separate from version 28, which is my current version of the program, effectively allowing me to run both versions if I wish to? I know there is supposed to be a way to set up ""profiles"", which supposedly allow people to run multiple versions of a browser, but I'm not clear on how to do so as I am not a Tech guy. What I would need are pretty much simple, idiot proof instructions, on how to do this, so that I can either have both versions capable of being run, or at least be able to install the new browser to my second internal drive which has ample space to handle everything that the browser requires, space wise.

Other browsers don't have this effect which is really irritating seeing as firefox is my all time favorite browser.
I can have as many regualr tabs in firefox open as i want without so much as a hiccup.
I would point toward the issue as being with the league client however other browsers don't cause this issue and i know im not the only one who experiences the exact same thing.
Support at Riot have no interest in the issue simply point at firefox as the issue or telling me to enable ""low spec"" mode.
The only plugin I am using for firefox is adblockplus.
Even on a fresh installation of windows, firefox and league the problem persists and as mentiond i have had friends install firefox and they have found the same problem.
I'd love to see this problem resovled not only for myself but for the health of firefox seeing as the amount of users doing the exact same thing I am must be a very significant one.

However when trying to type ""Alt+14B"" for the character ""ŋ"", firefox defaults to opening the bookmarks tab from the menu bar (which is the shortcut Alt + B in firefox). The B overrides the previous characters and firefox treats it as a shortcut instead of a unicode entry. Alt toggles the menu bar, but only if let go before a valid unicode is recognized. So i can write a schwa ""ə"" by typing ""Alt(plus sign)259"" but not ""ŋ"" (pasted here). Is there any way I can disable the ALT menu bar shortcut?

</p><p>I am using Firefox on different OS. I have read some threads about my question, but I still don´t understand.
</p><p>Let´s start with the OS / Firefox / Citrix Receiver I am using:
</p><p>1. Linux (Fedora 28) with Firefox 60.2.0esr (64bit) and Citrix Receiver 13.10.0.20
2. MacOS 10.12.6 with Firefox 61.0.1 (64bit) and Citrix Receiver 12.9.0 (52)
3. Windows 10 with Firefox 62.0 (64bit) and  Citrix Receiver 14.12.0.18020
</p><p>Additional info: on none of these systems, the citrix receiver is listed under ""about:plugins"".
</p><p>My question/problem is: When I open a remote desktop with systems 2 &amp; 3, it is opened in a new window on the system. But when I open it on system 1, Firefox opens it in a tab in the browser, that seems to mean that here, HTML5 is used. As I read quite in some threads, it might be a problem that Firefox is not supporting the plugin sinver version 52. But why is then used the external program on MacOS and Windows? 
</p><p>Overall, I want to understand why this happens. Can somebody help me in understanding what is happening here from the start?

1234735,1537520800,Can I make a button that toggles browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction from 0 to 2?,"<p>I’m used to a certain way of controlling all my tabs.*
</p><p>I need firefox‘s settings ‘browser.link.open_newwindow’ and ‘browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction’, to work the way I want to work.
But because some websites make links open in new tabs (technically in new windows I suppose), not via the target attribute, but via something else, I really want to set browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0. Just to normally browse the internet.**
</p><p>But some other websites who use scripts in a bona fide way for things like logging on, don‘t take users like me into account, who have set browser.link.open_newwindow to 1 and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0. For example, logging on to Feedly fails, because it can only be done in a pop-up. Expanding one message in Gmail also isn‘t possible with my settings.
</p><p>For such instances I would like to be able to toggle browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction from 0 to 2. Or from 0 to 1, that would be just as good. It just needs to be 0 as a default, but toggled to something else when needed.
</p><p>I wouldn‘t know the first thing about making such a button. I guess what I‘m asking is: how easy is it to make one (if it doesn’t exist already) and are there instructions somewhere, that are comprehensable for a layperson?
</p><p>———
</p><p> * If I left-click on something it means I want to leave the current webpage and go to the clicked webpage in a the same tab. The things I want to open in a new tab to read soon, I open in a new tab, and it opens in the background as the rightmost tab. A part of my brain makes sure the amount of tabs doesn‘t grow too large. Something interrupting I need to read right now I open in a new window. I’ve always worked like this. Even the last years, when more and more websites and browsers started to push a model where tabs are opening left and right, the back button suddenly closes a tab and moves the focus somewhere unexpected etc.
</p><p> ** a good example of a website which would still open left-clicked links in a new tab even with browser.link.open_newwindow set to 1 is <a href=""http://quora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">quora.com</a>, but that‘s just one I think of and there are many, many more.

1234736,1537521246,Modal works in Firefox but not in private window,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>I have an issue where a modal works in regular Firefox, but not when private mode is used. And, there is no ""Allow/Block pop-ups for this site"" information bar in Firefox's private browsing when the issue occurs - nor was that setting previously disabled.
</p><p>I'm running Firefox version 62.0. It says it's up-to-date. I cleared browser cache and the issue still occurs.

1 - Firefox Audio works fine on my Mac and internal Speakers.
2 - Firefox Audio does NOT work when I'm using my Firewire Presonus 16.0.2 Mixer for sound.  It is always connected to this mixer cause I use this MacBook pro for recording.
3 - All ""Drivers"" - which aren't really a thing for Macs - are up to date for the hardware path from Mac to Mixer.  Goes MBPro -&gt; OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock (with a thunderbolt 3 cable) -&gt; Firewire 800 cable out to Presonus Mixer.
4 - all other system Audio and the same websites sites work on other browsers like Chrome, safari...etc.
</p><p>So I need help figuring out where the breakdown happened - this stopped working sometime over the summer.  It had worked perfectly up till then.  I can't understand why all other sounds on my system work great through my Audio interface, and even Firefox Audio works fine when going through the system speakers.  It just seems like at some point Firefox decided to specifically reject my Audio interface.
</p><p>Please look for solutions that are more advanced to start with - I've done every simple trouble-shooting tip one could think of.  and I'm only reaching out at this point for support because this seems like an error in the code.  Either Firefox is no longer supporting Firewire devices, or no longer supporting Pre-sonus devices, or thunderbolt docks?   Dunno...

1234754,1537535269,Feedback to improve Firefox!,"<p>Hi All,
</p><p>I love Mozilla; I want to love Firefox.
</p><p>In an effort to slowing down Google's dominance I am reluctant to use their products, including Chrome; they are taking over the world and their privacy policy is a joke.  The problem is that unfortunately there are a number of limitations with firefox which mean as a business we find it hard to use it on a daily basis over Chrome.  We are a small business running an office of 10; when we trialled firefox I had a load of moans initially - we have trialled for almost 4 months, but are now going to have to revert back.
</p><p>My three biggest gripes are;
</p><p>1.Copy, Paste and Find - this is the most important factor for me personally.
When you copy (using CTRL + C), then find (using CTRL + F) then paste (using CTRL + V) Chrome automatically removes the end space (if what you have copied via double clicking on a word/number has included the space) .  When using firefox and completely the same operation in a quick double click word, copy, find, paste scenario the browser shows nothing found on page, because it includes the space in the search.  Unsure how this is achieved in Chrome, but this is a huge inconvenience for me; although it sounds extremely small, it has forced me to go back to using Chrome!
</p><p>2. Capability issues;
Unfortunately there are a few sites which do not operate correctly with Firefox; when I query this with their support team (Barclaycard for example) they ALWAYS advise downloading Chrome to test - unfortunately this causes a vicious circle to increasing their market share... 
</p><p>3. Mobile - Running Android the firefox app is simply far far slower than Chrome - I'm unsure whether this is due to Google's advanatge with their own OS?! Is this experienced by everyone?  
</p><p>Regards,
</p><p>Mike

</p><p>I am using wordpress for my site, and have had an issue with people stealing content in the past. 
</p><p>Because of that I'm using a wordpress plugin that disables right click and copy paste. I know that it's not fool proof, and that it's still possible to view the source etc. if you know how.
</p><p>The problem I'm having at the moment though, is that the pages are still accessible in Firefox Reader view, and in Reader View all the content can be viewed in an unprotected way, and easily copy pasted. So if it's possible I'd like to add something (plugin / code or whatever is needed really) that will stop people from opening my pages in Reader View.
</p><p>Would anyone have any ideas on how to do that? 
</p><p>From what I've read, Reader View determines content to show based on markup in the code, so I could try stripping out the HTML tags, but not sure what that's going to do to my theme styling.

I know that there still used sometimes for internal networks.  But I have no need of that http basic auth mechanism and it only annoys me when I run into a Spam website that likes to spam me with that box.  Now I'm a knowledgeable guy and have been using Firefox since it was before 1.0 and before that Mozilla and Netscape.  So I know how to escape those nasty websites.  I am a long time (20 years) of Linux user and I just bought my first Windows Laptop and I am having much trouble with these http auth boxes on Windows.  On Linux they never popped up.  Now on my new Windows 10 Pro they have started to come out at me everywhere.
</p><p>This is not a request for help.  I can handle getting out of those websites just fine by myself.  My request is how do I permanently turn off the http auth dialog basic box mechanism.  Is there some kind of custom JavaScript I can use in the Firefox dir?  An about:config change?  Any help is much appreciated.  If I get a satisfactory answer I'll spread it far and wide and give credit where it's due.
</p><p>P.S.  My Laptop is secure, clean, and safe with nothing bad on it.  I have no programing knowledge of any kind including C, JavaScript, HTML.

This makes searching for things containing a '.' inconvenient. A more intelligent check should be done, maybe a check to see if the text contains a valid public suffix (<a href=""https://publicsuffix.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://publicsuffix.org</a>), since all websites should contain a valid public suffix. This is especially true since this list was originally created by Mozilla, i.e. they can easily integrate with it. Then searches containing '.' which are clearly not valid websites could be done from the URL searchbar.

I have tried everything. I use the extension Tabliss  for my custom home page- which is flawless and wonderful. My options page reflects this information correctly. Everything worked beautifully until I upgraded from 60.02 to 62. That's when it started - in addition to some other problems, which I have just about finished solving. If I click on the HOME icon in the upper left corner, it removes the blank page to reveal the custom home page beneath. I want every subsequent page to open in a new tab and my home to be left alone. Using an additional extension, I just about have that solved. But I shouldn't have to go through additional steps just to open my browser. It doesn't sound like much, but since 57 I have to jump through hoops just to get started - including dealing with the reduced convenient functionality of NoScript, a necessary addon. Finally, I have absolutely no interest in setting Firefox back to its default state, obliterating countless hours of work and organization - just in case that is on offer from your end. Thank you very much for you time and assistance.

</p><p>I'm using Firefox under the Openbox WM on Arch Linux    and  I cannot set client side window decorations. As sen in the picture, the ""Title Bar"" customize option changes actually nothing - the WM's default window decoration is still visible. The issue applies to all Firefox versions since the CSD option was introduced. I've tried creating a completely new (clean) Firefox profile but that did not help. Is that a bug or am I missing something important? Other apps (like Evince or Google Chrome for example) show client side decorations properly in my case, if that matters. 
Is that a   bug or am I missing something important in my system/config? Any kind of help will be highly appreciated, thanks in advance…

1235048,1537739719,Where does Firefox store 'sites visited'?,"<p>This refers to Firefox 62.0 running under Windows 10 Pro.
</p><p>In older versions of Firefox, one could effectively purge browsing history, either with a manual 'Clear History' command or by using a third-party utility like Ccleaner.  Such a purge would clear any history of Websites visited, such that when you began typing-in a URL in the Address Bar, you'd have to type in the whole name; that is, Firefox would not auto-fill-in the rest of the site name after a few telling keystrokes.  Of course some, if not all, search engines can be programmed to suggest sites, but in this case we're not talking about that, only what Firefox does all by itself.
</p><p>Effective with some fairly recent update, it appears that Firefox will remember sites you've visited, regardless of whether you want it to or not.  I can clear all history manually through Tools/Options/Privacy &amp; Security/History: Clear History, plus run Ccleaner with all Firefox options checked.  Then, even with the Internet temporarily disconnected, as soon as I type 'e' into the Address Bar, Firefox fills-in <a href=""http://eBay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">eBay.com</a>.  Same goes for 'a' and <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>, 'g' and <a href=""http://Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Google.com</a>, and all manner of sites I've visited, even if they are not one of the 'usual suspects.'  In fact, if I type in a couple of letters, up comes a site I believe I've visited only once.
</p><p>From a security and privacy standpoint, this is disconcerting.  Not that I have anything sinister to hide, but I tried the same thing with Internet Explorer and it does not do this.  Evidently all these site visits are stored somewhere on my machine and cannot easily be purged.  If I knew what specific file held this information, I could direct Ccleaner there to wipe it, or simply delete that file manually. 
</p><p>I thought this might have something to do with Bookmarks, that Firefox would look among bookmarked site names and suggest those, but I tested that possibility and it's not that.  I can begin typing-in the site name of a bookmarked URL and the auto-fill does not function.  But other sites I've visited, that are not bookmarked, will populate with a suggestion or two.   Please, what can I do?

Both were updated to the latest version, 63.0b8 (64bit), few days ago, and were running smoothly until yesterday when while running it with 3 tabs suddenly the notebook stopped, and I couldn't do anything as couldn't even move mouse, so after few minutes I could open the Task Manager and find out that the 3 Firefox processes were consuming like 110% of CPU, so took like 10min for the processes to go down and finally I could see that Firefox was really consuming such CPU processing time, so I uninstalled both versions, and re-installed then again, and then seems problem was still happening with high CPU usage, so I tried to install the previous 63.0b7 version and always it was updated automatically to the 63.0b8 version, even that on Options I kept the manual update.
As during the re-install of both versions I didn't see that it was using a different profile, then at the end, I lost the bookmarks I had in one profile, so now I can't run any previous version, as both Dev and normal edition always update automatically.

</p><p>By looking at technical info and logs I see that firefox sends out many HTTP requests rapidly. Sends many out before receiving a response to one.  I think what happens is there are so many responses coming rapidly from the servers that some get dropped in the local internet due to limits on the amount of traffic (congestion).  My local internet is known to have limitations.
</p><p>So I want to try throttling firefox, that is make it send out HTTP requests slowly or wait for a reply before sending the next request. How can I do that?

1235261,1537888812,Manual update?,"<p>Hello :-),
</p><p>someone reported to me that they were prompted to update Firefox inside Firefox (somewhere in the top right corner), but they said they weren't redirected anywhere (like a page with a blue background for example). They also say that it wasn't a full width bar and that there was no heart icon.
</p><p>When clicking on that 1 or more windows opened, and they put in the admin credentials (the user doesn't have admin privileges).
</p><p>Then after what followed the start menu link to Firefox was broken, and in the list of installed programs there was only an x86 version of Firefox listed, but without an icon. It claims to have been there for at least 15 days though. There is also a ""Mozilla Firefox"" folder in ""Programs (x86). This is 64bit Windows 10 though and to my knowledge I installed 64bit Firefox (using the standard download button), which I would expect to be in the ""Programs"" folder (and so it is on other machines).
</p><p>When trying to uninstall Firefox via the list of installed programs, after entering the admin credentials nothing happened.
</p><p>When downloading a fresh installer and trying to install Firefox with that, when entering the admin credentials and clicking ""yes"" a window with a typo in it pops up saying that Firefox already had been installed and asking if it should be reinstalled. When clicking ""no"" the same window pops up. So after clicking no, without having entered any admin credentials (assuming that it might not work), I confirmed that I wanted to reinstall Firefox in that window, and the installer actually finished.
</p><p>After that Firefox opened on its own. The start menu link is still broken, Firefox is still only in ""Programs (x68)"", but at least in the list of installed programs it's listed as x64 now, with an icon.
</p><p>When typing ""Firefox"" in the search and examining the location of that program, it says it's in AppData\Local\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe. I currently only have a Developer Edition to compare it to but abstracting from that I would expect it to be in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe.
</p><p>What is going on?
</p><p>I don't recall ever being prompted to update Firefox inside Firefox. Of course though since the user doesn't have admin privileges that might be interfering with the normal process. I've experienced updates failing due to a lack of admin privileges before though on other computers, and I had to start Firefox as admin and search for updates via the ""Help -&gt; About"" menu to get them to install.
</p><p>Is the behaviour described above legitimate? Aside from all that being kinda weird everything seems to be working now (with Firefox running from AppData\Local though). We don't wanna take any risks.
</p><p>Thanks!

I recently installed Firefox version 62.0, which is not great, although it is much better than Debian's Firefox ESR.
</p><p>I used some special method which turned up on a DuckDuckGo search.  As a preliminary step, it had me install something called Snap.  The whole installation process was simple, virtually automatic.   However, since Sept 21, I have been receiving notices that Firefox is unable to download version 62.0.2.  I have also been unable to download v. 62.0.2 manually.
</p><p>I used the ""locate"" command which indicates that several Firefox files are in directories such as ""/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/firefox_firefox.desktop,"" among others.  I suppose that Firefox  is looking for a certain file in a directory, which is in one of these snap or snapd directories.
</p><p>I am reluctant to attempt to uninstall ver.62.0, and then attempt to install ver.62.0.2.  I believe I could download and install the ver.62.0.2 tarball, if I knew what directory to download it to.  Can you tell me what the name of that directory?  If so, I might be able to find that directory in the snap or snapd directories that I have.

1235290,1537911437,Memory leak in Private mode,"<p>Hello, I'm here more to report a bug than to ask a question, but I couldn't get myself to work with Bugzilla, it asks too many things.
</p><p>So you know how sometimes you open a bunch of tabs in ""Private Browsing"" just so you have a separate window to close everything at once when it's not needed anymore, well usually in the case of Chrome and Edge, it clears the ram that window was using, instantly no problem... Firefox doesn't really do that and I find it quite worrying if you call it ""Private browsing"", in fact, closing tabs doesn't really seem to close them at all! 
</p><p>In chrome, when you close 10 tabs you see the ram usage dropping quite clearly, with Firefox it just stays there and it's even worse when I close the whole private window and because I have a normal Firefox window still open, it doesn't clear any ram! 
</p><p>Yesterday I had windows explorer crash because of this and it closed word while I was working on it, go to task manager and Firefox is using 5GB of ram with 5 tabs open... Every damn day I use lots of tabs I have to close Firefox completely and open it again with the same goddamn saved tabs to clear 3gb of memory or more! 
</p><p>Really I want to like this browser, but first of all, this must be a horrible programming practice and second I doubt this is safe at all, keeping closed tabs for hours in memory waiting for the program to close can't be safe, it just can't!
</p><p>How to reproduce this memory leak? Have Firefox with a normal window open, then open another normal or private browsing window, open a bunch of tabs there, watch memory usage rise, then close that window and watch it not drop at all. 
Way around it? Close Firefox and re-open.
Could it be an add-on bug? Maybe, you tell me if it works with you, but it would still mean there's a bug with Firefox itself.
</p><p>Really simple, I have no idea why this is a thing, isn't it supposed to have a separate process that clears memory when you close it? I have my doubts it's working like that.

Earlier, I created a new profile using profile manager, for an earlier Quantum version Fx 60.x esr..
</p><p>Then copied  several  of MOST recent days  of bookmark backups (.jsonlz4 files) from the  PRE-Quantum profile into the new Quantum profile above, that has only been used with  Fx Quantum versions.
Note:  Some of the jsonlz4 files were copy &amp; pasted from old legacy to new quantum profile; after that, Quantum backups  were automatically created (so should be compressed?).
</p><p>Are there easier ways than I know about, to quickly tell if 2 bookmarks files contain *approximately* the same number of non-corrupted bookmarks - in a human readable way, or file comparison (in Linux) that creates a list of elements found only in one file? 
</p><pre>Is there a way (say, convert to a spreadsheet or CSV, etc, to find all differences in specific column, or something  similar?
</pre>
<p>I'm not so sure something didn't go wrong, moving bookmarks from a Legacy profile to Quantum profile.
</p><p>The places.sqlite files are IDENTICAL size  in both the old legacy profile vs. new Quantum profile.
That's a little odd, as exporting to html - the most recent bookmark files of legacy &amp; quantum profiles and comparing them, the legacy bookmarks.html files have a LOT more lines (~ 3000 more lines- ""line numbers"", in text a editor ).  Graphics / icons count as one line, so larger icons or higher resolution doesn't explain a much larger # of LINES in the legacy html file .  Maybe that's if bookmarks in places.sqlite don't contain descriptions - ever.
</p><p>The automatically backed up Legacy bookmarks*.jsonlz4 are considerably larger than the equivalent Quantum automatic  backups.  The files I'm comparing should have nearly the same bookmarks.   
No significant additions or deletions of bookmarks were made to either Legacy or Quantum bookmarks, so that's probably not the size difference.
</p><p>Mozilla said? they wouldn't SHOW bookmark descriptions starting in Fx 62 (that's now), BUT WOULDN'T REMOVE  the descriptions DATA from bookmark files  until a LATER Fx version, so <a href=""http://Ghacks.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Ghacks.net</a> says.
</p><p>Comparing the exported bookmarks from Legacy &amp; Quanum profiles, seems clear the Quantum HTML  files do not contain any descriptions.   Quantum bookmarks*.jsonlz4 files are ~ *35% smaller  than  Legacy files (that should contain the same set of bookmarks.
</p><p>I'd guess that either Mozilla removed descriptions sooner than promised, or moving Legacy bookmark files to Quantum profiles removes descriptions, intended  or not.

1235315,1537935488,How to prevent DOWNLOADING of video (not merely prevent autoplay) in Firefox,"<p>This may sound like word games, but I'm not trying to be funny, merely specific.
</p><p>So I'm on a network with limited bandwidth.  Therefore it's critical for me to understand what settings I can configure (if any) that will prevent the DOWNLOAD of video and/or large images from web sites.
</p><p>For example, your basic site nowadays probably uses HTML5 and may use that vs. the old-style Flash plug-ins to embed video.  And yep classic HTML links with references to image files for the images.
</p><p>Back in the day you could configure a browser to ignore these references and then the browser would not even attempt to fetch the referenced image or video files.  I've recently started using Firefox again, and I'm trying to learn how Firefox handles this in the HTML5 era (or rather what dumb users like me are supposed to do nowadays).
</p><p>I'm noticing most of the help literature is regarding disabling settings of the auto-PLAY feature.  However, due to my ignorance of modern Firefox, perhaps I'm reading it wrong, but most of it seems to involve disabling plug-ins that activate after the file is downloaded, not preventing the actual download.  Similar to if I'm using Microsoft Word to view a DOCX file from a web site, uninstalling Word doesn't prevent the DOCX file from downloading.  What I don't want to do is cheerfully disable the video playing while my browser still happily downloads the video in the background... because my main goal is not to avoid the annoyance of autoplay, but my goal is to conserve bandwidth on my connection.
</p><p>FYI I'm using the latest version of Firefox Quantum on Manjaro Linux.
</p><p>Thanks for advice anyone can provide in helping bring me into the ""now"" of modern Firefox, or who can point me to any further help articles or instructions to help educate me about this.  If I'm over-reading and disabling auto-PLAY also inherently disables the downloading of the associated media, super, but that distinction is not obvious in any of the documentation I've seen so far.

1235316,1537935590,How can I get WebAdvisor  to work for a Google search in Windows 7?,"<p>On both my Windows 10 machine and my Windows 7 machine, I am using Firefox Quantum 62.0.2 and the information at Tools&gt;Add-on&gt;Extensions says that McAfee WebAdvisor 6.0.0.136 is enabled.
</p><p>I get the McAfee WebAdvisor green icons to show up for a Google search on my Windows 10 machine. However, I cannot get them to show up for a Google search on my Windows 7 machine.
</p><p>Why do I get the green icons in a Firefox Google search on the Windows 10 machine, but I do not get them on the same search on the Windows 7 machine???  Google is a default search engine for Firefox on both machines.
</p><p>I might add that I get the green icons for a Bing search on both the Windows 7 and the Windows 10 machine.  Bing is also a default search engine on both machines.  But, only Windows 10, and not Windows 7,  will show the green icons in a Google search.  This is strange!!  What can I do to get them to show up in the Firefox browser Google search on Windows 7??
</p><p>I read a post there dated 9/21/2018 that said Firefox 62 doesn’t support WebAdvisor.  But that doesn’t seem to be true, 1) McAfee WebAdvisor is listed as an add-on; 2) I get the green icons when I do a Bing Search on my Windows 7, and I get the green icons when I do a Bing search AND a Google search on my Windows 10.  It’s only a Google search on Windows 7 that does not produce them.  What can I do to get them to show up for a Google search in Windows 7?

1235318,1537942669,Mozilla Firefox stopped correctly displaying some pages,"<p>I have been using Mozilla Firefox (MF) for many years. Now 64-bit version 64.0.2 is installed. However, suddenly some pages started to display in incorrect way. For example, login page of <a href=""http://Freelancer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Freelancer.com</a> is not displayable by MF, but is displayable by internet explorer, see attachments. I thought that it deals with java or javascript blocking, but javascript.enabled is set to true. Safe mode for MF gives the same.
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any idea,
