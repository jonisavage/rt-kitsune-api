1223249,1530044149,comment récupérer une partie de ses marques pages supprimés.,"<p>bonjour à tous;
</p><pre>je travaille avec quantum 60.0.2 (64 bits) ; win7;
</pre>
<p>PROBLÈME: j'ai 5000 Marques Pages
Lorsque j'avais 4800 M.P. il y a quelques jours j'ai supprimé un sous/sous/sous/dossier qui en contenait une centaine. je dispose en format Json de la sauv. totale automatique des M.P. avant cette suppression intempestive. 
Je ne peux l'importer car je ne souhaite pas écraser mes 5000 par seulement 4800 M.P.
</p><p>LES 2 SOLUTIONS auxquelles j'ai pensé:
</p><p>1°) Compliquée : J'ai donc songé à créer un second profil et importer la sauv. contenant le dossier supprimé.
Sera t'il possible sur un seul ordi? (ou bien plusieurs, si nécessaire) d'ouvrir les deux profils simultanément et copier un par un les liens afin de reconstruire mon dossier supprimé au sein des 5000 M.P. actuel ?
</p><p>2°) Plus simple : Sauvegarder les 5000 M.P. (afin de les utiliser en cours d'opé.) 
Importer MES 4800 comportant le dossier supprimé.
Supprimer sur cet ordi. tous les M.P. sauf le dossier qui me manque.
Créer une Sauv. des M.P. au format HTML.
Importer ma sauv. réalisée en commençant des 5000M.P. actuel.
Importer au format HTML la sauv. du dossier seul (initialement supprimé) réalisée ci-dessus. Il s'ajoutera dans le ""Menu des Marques Pages"" 3°) Sauvegarder les 5000 M.P. (afin de les utiliser en cours d'opé.) 
Importer MES 4800 comportant le dossier supprimé.
Voyez-vous une façon plus simple de procéder ?
</p><p>Je ne comprends pas que quantum n'intègre pas une fonction comparable à l'importation des sauv. natives d'un autre navigateur qui permettrait d'importer des M.P. dans un dossier que nous choisirions.
</p><p>J'indique mes solutions afin d'aider ceux qui cherche avec un outil en français et ne trouvent rien comme moi auparavant.
</p><p>Merci par avance de votre aide. (s'il y a mieux que ma seconde proposition)

(Booting from Flash Drive),"<p>I am currently experiencing problems using Firefox 42.0 on a customised Ubuntu Linux platform. The issue I am experiencing involves Firefox crashing, usually when I try to open a new page. 
</p><p>The issue is intermittent, and a temporary fix can be achieved, by restarting the OS, however, this doesn’t last more than an hour if that. The OS isn’t run from the computer hard drive, but from a flash drive provided by the company I am contracting for, as this is their policy.  
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am unable to make any changes/upgrades to the OS or browser, due to the way it is configured. 
</p><p>The technical support agent at the company I work for, has advised me that the crash is caused because by upload speed is only 0.96 Mbps, where it should be 1 Mbps. Additionally, they also advised the consistency of service for my ISP is 52% and needs to be higher. 
</p><p>My ISP has run tests on my internet connection and believe everything is working as it should be. Could the upload speed and consistency of service, cause Firefox to crash, or is it likely to be another issue?

1223341,1530047700,"after installing ff 61-x64, ff auto update changed desktop icon to x32 version 57.","<p>Automatic updates are turned off in my Firefox installation.    Today, I updated v56.0 x32 to v61.0 x64 via a full download and install.  Since I noted that the help|about menu wanted to update to v57, and v61 was available, I elected to do the full .exe download and install of v61 instead.    I selected the install option to install the background updater feature (I forget what exactly it was called), figuring that it wouldn't be active  as long as I had updates turned off in the general options.  I chose to accept the default of having icons on the desktop, shortcuts, etc.   Once the install was complete, I started v61 normally.  
</p><p>A few minutes after the successful install, I received another firefox installer UAC blank screen request for permission to update, which I approved, since I figured there were last-minute updates to v61.    The next time I started Firefox, I got version 57 per help|about, and a warning that it was out of date.   Although this version is x64, it is running in ""Program Files (x32)"" while the v61 is running in ""Program Files.""   The unexpected install of v57 down-leveled all my icons and shortcuts to point to the v57 version.   If I hadn't had the benefit of multiple firewall warnings, and known how to interpret what I was seeing, this could have been quite unpleasant.  As it is, an easy upgrade has now taken most of the afternoon.  
</p><p>Apparently what happened is that the x32 version was not deleted and  after the installer was active, it decided that the v56.0 version needed to be updated too.  If I did not have my firewall running with program controls on Firefox per .exe location, it would have been much more difficult to realize what was going on.  I'm still a little murky on how the second upgrade got kicked off, but I imagine it'll be clearer to someone who knows the internals.
</p><p>Suggested solutions:
</p><p>(1) When an x64 version is installed, the users should be prompted for disposition of the older x32 version.   Deleting of the prior version is the normal action when updating, so there should be an option to treat the upgrade to x64 the same way.
</p><p>(2) Installer should not down-level shortcuts (in my case from v61 to v57), at least not without getting user permission.
</p><p>(3) ALL facilities should honor the update settings in the firefox options.  Whatever did this update ignored the settings that I have verified in both versions to be set to ""Never Check for Updates.""    Part of this was my fault; at first I thought that the x61 version had some last minute updates needed so I told clicked to allow.
</p><p>(4) Once an instance is started, Firefox always uses that version when a shortcut is used, even if the shortcut points to a different version.  For example, if v61 is already running, and I click one of my shortcuts, a new v61 window is started.  If nothing is running when I click the same shortcut, v57 starts.  This behavior may cause additional confusion in an already murky situation.  The shortcut should either start the version it points to or issue a message that it can't be started until the other version is quit.
</p><p>(5) It appears that the ""Mozilla Maintenance Service"" is installed under the program files x32 folder, and there is a maintenance service installer log from today.  There is no maintenance service folder under program files, even though I think this is probably what I asked to have it installed.  I don't see any warning in the v61 firefox install log that installation was bypassed.   Again, it seems to me that such convolution is ripe for future issues, and the maintenance service should have been installed with v61, or at least a warning issued if that would be too complicated and it needed to be left in the program files x32 folder.  
</p><p>I believe that implementation of these suggestions would help prevent a number of similar sounding problems I have seen reported.
</p><p>I do have three related questions:
</p><p>(a) The background silent update installer that is an option during the v61 install - what does it do and will it honor ""Never Check for Updates?""  If not, how do I disable it?
</p><p>(b) What does the Tools|Options|General option ""Use background service to install updates"" do?  Does that need to be un-checked to disable silent updates, or will the ""Never Check for Updates"" option prevent its activation until I manually select an update? 
</p><p>(c) How do I get rid of the v57 version without also loosing the installer service and without having to delete both versions and loose my config?  
</p><p>If anyone is concerned about my use of the ""Never Check for Updates"" option please rest assured that I have years as a security professional and I have good reason for selecting this option.  Appropriate controls are in place.
</p><p>Thanks for your help.  It is appreciated.

I then discovered that there was a new pref in about:config browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enableWideLayout, set to true by default, and setting it to false returned me to the 6 sites per row as previously and which I liked and wanted.
</p><p>Today the update to FF61 happened, and the 8 sites per row were back. I thought that maybe the browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enableWideLayout pref had been set back to true by the upgrade, but it hadn't been - it was and still is set to false. So why have I got 8 sites per row again, and how do i go back to 6 per row?

</p><p>I set YT to be in dark mode and region United States. And from time to time, random time, it somehow loses settings and reverts back to white mode and region Serbia. Even when I'm using FF, or even when I close FF and open it again. It doesn't matter.
</p><p>Note: I tried before, when YT changed it's UI and FF quantum was iin previous versions, to delete cookies.sqlite so that new cookies would be recreated. But that didn't helped.
</p><p>So I decided to see what is wrong with cookies.sqlite with DB brower for sqlite.
</p><p>Searched under host column for youtube and I got this line (image attached) that is a bit weird.
</p><p>Under value column there is a date 2017/10/22 (I don't know what 09-0 is). So I changed value to YES+US.en+20180605-09-0 wrote changes, copied back to profile folder and for now it is working.
</p><p>Will get back if it doesn't.

1223510,1530136047,Disable tab network priority,"<p>I am experiencing a rather hard to understand problem with Firefox 61. If I open a tab on a livestream and start to navigate someplace else in another tab, the stream will start lagging massively. I can replicate the problem without difficulties: If I open two livestreams basically, the first will completely freeze as soon as I give the focus to the second, but if I focus an empty tab or static webpage it will come back right away, as if the first tab was so low on priority that it simply wasn't updated any longer. 
</p><p>My internet connection is clearly not a problem here (1 Gbps fiber optic, and I experience no such issues when opening even a dozen streams on Chromium) I have also tried doing the same after disabling all extensions but the problem persisted.

</p><p>Is there a way to get access to those shots so to delete them forever?

I gather the issue is with the data stored in the storage.js)?

Also this morning,suddenly Gmail is now getting the 'no secure connection' message,the only way around that is to turn off the 'Enable HTTPS scanning' option in Avast [which isn't a good option,it's supposed to be an added security risk without that enabled] Every other website is fine,it's only Gmail getting this.

</p><p>Hi. I am developing an intranet application. We have an old asp web forms site with lots of small js and css files and also a modern part written on angular with several large resource files. 
And recently I encountered a problem with slow page opening for one of the clients that has a slow internet connection. Looks like Firefox 58 (we cannot upgrade immediately due to security concerns) stops using some cached resources and starts requesting them from the server. If I clear all cached files for several minutes everything is good, all files are reported as 304 and are taken from cache and page loads in several seconds. We have cache control headers set to Public, Expired in 2024 and MaxAge 30 days. But 5 minutes later the picture changes - several files begin to be requested each time without etag header and modified date resulting a full download. I tried increasing cache size to 1GB, adding immutable to max age but none of that changed the behavior. I can see all the files in about:cache but stil Firefox doesn't use them.
Is the any way to diagnose the problem or any known solution?

1223590,1530184820,Sometimes static resource files stop beeing cached despite cache control headers,"<p>Hi. I am developing an intranet application. An recently we encountered a very slow page opening at one of our clients in a remote location with slow internet access. The problem seems to be related to that some files stop been cached despite cache control headers. We are using Firefox 58 and cannot quickly upgrade to a newer version due to security concerns. 
When I clear browser cache everything is good. We have cache control headers set to Public, Expired in 2024 and MaxAge for 30 days. All js and css files are reported 304, taken from cache and page loads within several seconds. But several minutes later some files begin to be downloaded again with each page refresh. We have and an old asp web forms app with lots of small js and css resources as well a new part that is rewritten with angular and assembled in a few large minified files. The problem happens to a random set of those and due to slow connection load time increases dramatically. I can see all the files on about:cache page but nevertheless they are requested without Etag match or Last modified date and so server responses with full content. 
I tried to increase cache size up to 1GB without smart managing, adding immutable to max age. But nothing changes the behavior.
Is there any way to diagnose the problem or any known solution?

I have FF installed and not too many add ons installed.

1 - who I am
2 - my password

If I log in, and log out, then try to log back in is where the problem happens.
(Yes, I know:  who would do that?  But this is just me forcing the problem to happen.)
</p><p>I click in the first field and enter who I am.
Then, I can either move the mouse and click on the second field or press &lt;TAB&gt; to get to it.
Either way the first field is WIPED CLEAR.
</p><p>Granted doing it with all add ons disabled it works.
</p><p>But it brings me to my real question about:  ""How do I get from having ALL of them disabled to enabling them one at a time to see which one is causing the problem?""
</p><p>It would be nice if there was a way that when you select ""Start with all add ons disabled"" you can go to about:addons and enable them one at a time.

With this latest update I get 10 which fills literally half the screen but most importantly, I don't want URLs from any site for which I visited once and probably never will again.

Until the day came where Chrome stopped supporting Unity, Chrome lost interest to me that day. I was told Firefox still supported unity, and when I tested it that proved true. So I began using Firefox more than Chrome, after getting my Windows 10 I forgot Unity existed. I installed Opera and I loved it, as it stands Opera is one of THE BEST browsers available. Nowadays it's proven that If you don't use Chrome or Opera, you're using a terrible browser. NO OTHER BROWSER is as useful as those two, Firefox was useful because it ran Unity. But now it doesn't appear that Firefox does, making it as useless as Internet explorer. I was told that Firefox 45 should still run Unity, so I went to try and download it(from the official site). But when installing it simply installed the most recent version that I couldn't care less for, this is upsetting and If Firefox will no longer support Unity I will NEVER use it again. Edge and Internet Explorer exist so it's not like i'm desperate for another browser, besides Chrome and Opera do almost everything I could ever need a browser to do...

For example, I go to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox</a>, scroll down to ""See also"", click ""Mozilla Prism"" link there, and then the Firefox' back button; I land at the beginning of the Firefox article instead of the place I was last, i.e. around ""See also"".
</p><p>Reading long articles and navigating back and forth to references is currently not possible, unless I open every link in new tab/window without leaving the original page.
</p><p>Chrome and Vivaldi don't exhibit such behavior, going back in history brings me to the vertical scroll position of where I left. I also *think* in old Firefox the behavior was consistent with Chrome.
</p><p>BTW, navigation with URL fragment also doesn't work. If you enter <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#See_also"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#See_also</a> into new tab, you are correctly moved to ""See also"" section. From there, click ""XUL Runner"" and going back moves you to the top of the Firefox page, where you never were... Refreshing the page doesn't change that. BUT forced refreshing (Shift+Ctrl+R) with cache skipped moves you correctly to ""See also"" section again.
</p><p>Linux Mint 18.2, Firefox 60.0.2 from Mint repos. I don't see such behavior under Windows (same version, official build), where it works as under Chrome. Is it some setting, or a bug? (Firefox? Mint? Ubuntu? other?)

</p><p>THERE IS A SECOND MAJOR ISSUE.  
Once a download file is flagged as containing malware there is a bug in Firefox.  The only options offered by Firefox are ""REMOVE FILE"" or ""OPEN"".  ""OPEN"" should not be an option at this point.  The options should be ""DOWNLOAD ANYWAY"" or ""REMOVE FILE"".  With the current options and an .exe file (if downloaded) will be immediately executed resulting in infection if the file is tainted.  With my suggested options, If a user chooses to ""DOWNLOAD ANYWAY"" then Firefox should remind the user the file may be infected and should recommend that the file be scanned by the user's antivirus/malware software before opening.

1223807,1530292517,Loading stops,"<p>I have a bookmarked page I have used for years that involves an ePaper. 
Last weekend FF opened the cover page and stopped. I dumped the book mark, searched for the site and it opened with full functionality except the ePaper. It still only opened on the cover page but It would not open the paper itself. That is the same situation today.
However, this page and ePaper function absolutely normally on Safari so FF - not unusal for this to happen - did an update and screwed me up.
Any ideas?

</p><p>I am developing a web service using REST API. This REST API is running on port 6443 for HTTPS.
Client is going to be a Single page application running on port 443 for HTTPS on same machine.
The problem I am facing is:
</p><p>While I hit the url say:  <a href=""https://mymachine.com/new_ui"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymachine.com/new_ui</a>
I get certificate exception for an invalid certificate because I use a self signed one, so <a href=""http://mymachine.com:443"" rel=""nofollow"">mymachine.com:443</a> gets added to server exception. But still requests doen't go to REST API as they are running on <a href=""https://mymachine.com:6443/restservice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymachine.com:6443/restservice</a>.
If I manually add <a href=""http://mymachine.com:6443"" rel=""nofollow"">mymachine.com:6443</a> to server exception on firefox it works but it will not be the case in production for customers.
</p><p>Some options that I thought are:
1. Give another pop up and ask to add REST server on port 6443 exception too. 
</p><pre>   But this doesn't look proper as why an end user should accept the cerf for same domain twice.
   Also REST api server port can change. 
</pre>
<p>2. Can we programmatically add exception for domain and both the ports in one shot? Ofcourse with the consent of the user.
3. Use a reverse proxy. But then its going to have memory footprint on our system. Also it will be time consuming.
</p><p>Please suggest some options. How do I deal with it.

</p><p>A bit of an odd one this I think. Have already read all the other threads regarding search problems and pretty sure this isn't the same thing at all.
</p><p>No matter what I type into the URL / search box it first very quickly flashes up with a Google link (which is what I have set in my preferences for Firefox [I'm using the Developer Edition] to use) then it redirects to Yahoo and uses their search instead.
</p><p>I have checked all plugins / extensions in Firefox and there are none installed that would do anything like this.
</p><p>Luckily I was able to halt the browser from performing the redirect so I copied the URL that shows before being redirected to Yahoo.
</p><p>This is the sort of URL that I am getting :
</p><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=dog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=dog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab</a>
</p><p>Notice the &amp;client=firefox-b-ab at the end. If I take that off the end of the URL then it searches as it should do with Google however with me not changing the URL (which happens automatically as soon as I type something in to search) then it redirects to Yahoo which leads me to believe that Google is redirecting Firefox based upon the fact that it is Firefox?
</p><p>Why they would do that is utterly beyond me though?
</p><p>Thanks for any help with this as I'd really love to be able to get back to having Google as my default search engine again as soon as possible.
</p><p>Best wishes,
</p><p>Mark

When the video plays, the video audio is in sync with the video but the duplicated audio plays in the background out of sync. I tried looking at add-ons and tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. I tried other recommended fixes but the problem persisted. I did not have the same problem when viewing videos in Internet Explorer. 
</p><p>I discovered a simple solution. I had sometime back installed another video program called VSL Video. I never used it and had forgotten it was installed. Apparently, VSL Video was trying to run in the background every time I would use Firefox to view YouTube videos. I did not have the problem with Internet Explorer. I uninstalled VSL Video and the duplicate audio problem went away. I hope this helps someone with the same problem.

1224024,1530457547,In wich table does firefox store bookmark labels?,"<p>One of the sites for which I have saved a lot of bookmarks has changed their url structure. 
- they moved from http to https
- they moved pages into a different folder
</p><p>When I visited a bookmark, I was redirected to the new location, but that new location didn't show as being bookmarked.
</p><p>I found an article that explained that the bookmarks are saved in the database file places.sqlite so I used an sqlite editor to search &amp; replace the url in the moz_places table » url field. That part worked great, all these bookmarks in Firefox now have the correct url.
</p><p>But still, whenever I go to a bookmarked place, it still doesn't show the blue star that indicates the page has been bookmarked. 
</p><p>Also, these bookmarks have labels in the library, but these labels are not shown when I select a bookmark in the library, as you can see in the attached screenshot.
</p><p>I guess my search &amp; replace action damaged some internal reference, but I can't find which reference. I have checked every table in the places.sqlite database file, and can't find the table that holds these labels.

Most of us are returning to IE or Chrome, but this is a hassle as it's difficult to smoothly migrate across and we also lose any add-on tools that we've become familiar with.

I use Avast anti-virus and Cleanup Premium and have scanned the system for Malware or Viruses.  The problem is that Firefox does not seem to be compatible with Windows at all.  I get frequent system hangups and stalls with messages displayed across the screen in a yellow bar that reads, ""This web page is slowing down your browser"".  Two choices are given and neither choice ends the hang up:  Stop Script or Wait.  This doesn't just happen on one website.  It happens throughout the day.  If I have been using the computer, then leave the house for a few hours and come back, I come back to a completely locked up screen.  The system gets slower and slower and slower as it is used throughout the day.  Sometimes, my screen turns completely black and wiggling my mouse or hitting a key on the keyboard doesn't wake it up.  I have to do the Control-Alt-Delete thing five or six times to wake it back up and Sign Out and Sign Back In.  Then, all is back to normal for a while.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox with no improvement.  It doesn't seem to happen with other browsers; however, I have always liked the option of keeping my Toolbar at the top of my screen with Bookmarks where I can alphabetize my bookmarked webpages and stick them in alphabetically-arranged folders, etc.  You can't organize your bookmarks or favorites as well using other browsers.  You get stuck with a non-alphabetical list, stupid stars, etc.  I hate all other options.  It is MUCH MORE efficient this old way.  I would like to keep using Firefox, but this cannot continue.  Is there any other advice that you can offer that I have not tried to stop these stalls and hangups?

1224041,1530469859,removed search engines keep coming back,"<p>Search engines that I removed from my list of one-click search engines (in the Firefox options) reappear after a month or so.  This has happened a couple of times already.  I suspect that the reappearance is triggered by a Firefox update, but am not sure about that.  The search engines that I keep removing and that keep reappearing after a while are
- Bing
- <a href=""http://bol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bol.com</a>
- <a href=""http://Marktplaats.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">Marktplaats.nl</a>
</p><p>I'm using Firefox on Windows 10 Home, with Dutch regional settings.  I cannot find evidence of having (unwittingly) installed any Windows applications or Firefox extensions or plugins associated with these search engines (except that Bing is a Microsoft product and might be integrated into the operating system).  Neither ""<a href=""http://bol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bol.com</a>"" nor ""marktplaats"" occur in my Windows registry.
</p><p>What is causing these search engines to keep reappearing?  How can I prevent them from reappearing?  I notice an option in the ""General"" section of Firefox options whose description (translated to English) is ""Update search engines automatically"".  Is that the reason for the unwanted search engines reappearing?  I figured that that option meant ""update the search engines from your list automatically"" and would not install search engines that aren't currently in my list.

For submitting the survey they offer an Apple iPhone X for a really funny price ($1). Looks like a scam, doesn't it?

</p><p>I am a keyboard junkie - and on my Mac with Firefox the delete shortcut (""#"") does no longer work. It's the ONLY shortcut that stopped working. I can do anything else - I can navigate, move mails, go forward and back, write mails, etc - I just cannot delete any more.
</p><p>If I hit CMD-F and hit ""#"" it appears in the search box. I can enter it in the location bar. I can enter it in the search bar in GMail. I can enter it on any web page, I can use it just as before - it just has absolutely no effect in GMail. It does not work in the old AND the new GMail UI.
</p><p>It works in Chrome, though. But I love Firefox, and I will not switch to Chrome. And it should just work, IMHO ;) . I really don't get it.
</p><p>Things I've tried:
</p>
<ul><li> stopped pretty much ANY running tool
</li><li> restarted firefox with addons disabled
</li><li> cleaned out Firefox (shift-CMD-backspace, select ""All"", go)
</li></ul>
<p>Nothing helped.
</p><p>Does anybody have *any* idea why? This severely impacts my GMail productivity ...

Or,  if I manage to finally get to my e-mail's INBOX, every time I try to open a message, the tab crashes &amp; I have to reset.
I have yet to see what's all fired good about this new version of Firefox, when it keeps doing this to my PC.
In all fairness, when I log on to Firefox with my Dell laptop(OS: Windows 10), I have no problems with either Chrome OR Firefox, when it comes to opening up my e-mail
On my desktop, if I use the Google Chrome browser, I also do not have a problem opening my e-mail.
This as you might understand is infuriating when you have to re-set the tab every time.
Can SOMEBODY come up with a theory, or even a WILD GUESS as to what might be happening, and let me know??
For the record, I have checked updates, which are current, and, even went so far as to uninstall, then, re-install Firefox.

1224219,1530647088,imac update to 10.12.6 firefox update to 61.0 browsing history lost,"<p>IMac hard drive failed.  An authorized apple reseller installed a new hard drive and one memory stick and restored all my existing files, including Firefox history, from my external backup drive.  The installer also upgraded my os x from 10.11.6 to 10.12.6 and Firefox  (possibly an auto-update) to 60.0.2.  Firefox began crashing as much as every minute.  ""Gaa..window"" could restore my browsing history windows and tabs with no problem--even when I would crash all the way down to login or even restart.  This was an impossible situation and I did restore using a dozen crash reports to Firefox, which should be documented.  But then the worst happened; I think that during one of these crashes, Firefox auto-updated itself from 60.0.2 to 61.0.  Whether that caused the history loss, I cannot say.
</p><p>However at about that moment in the midst of one of these crashes, history windows and tabs stopped restoring.  Selecting the history menu button showed two or three very recent history items.  I tried ""Show all history"" and the items were paltry and recent.  I tried the (now) oldest option from the library menu, which is now ""June"" and found a couple of weeks worth of random individual tabs some of which may have predated the failure of the hard drive originally, but none of the lost windows and tabs that I had open minutes earlier.  I can speculate that what happened has something to do with the Firefox auto-updating to the higher version that happened during one of these crashes, also minutes ago, and I have perhaps some random fragment of the two versions--who knows.
</p><p>I thought I could do a restore using my external back up drive and Time Machine with Apple support of the phone line to no avail.  I have a desktop folder called ""Old Firefox Data"" that has bookmark data but no browser history items visible, and will not restore anyway. 
</p><p>If it helps with the original call to Apple on the subject continuous crashes, the technician said he had OS x 10.12.6 and Firefox 60.0.2 both running and had no crashes.  Whether he had many window and tabs open, I cannot say.  I was also advised by Apple to uninstall and then reinstall Firefox, which I did.    Perhaps I should tell you that my suddenly missing history on Firefox came from Google searches.  Also the lost browsing history was a dozen or so research articles, thus the loss is pretty hefty and probably not replaceable if I can't restore it.
</p><p>Time Machine has not proved to be much help, however I can still try to see if I can access the lost history directly through my external backup drive.  Also I have spent most of a day looking at Mozilla help article and found them to arcane, not to the point, and perhaps outdated.

1224339,1530645346,why firefox degrades performance during several hours?,"<p>I have been a long time Firefox user, but in the last months things began to deteriorate. I assembled my PC last February using moderately budget but modern components. Intel Core i3-7100, Asus PRIME B250M-K board, two DDR4 2400 4GB memory modules and a Nvidia 1050 graphics card. I still use Windows 7 Ultimate but keep it updated. I installed Firefox in the second day and everything run smoothly during the first weeks. Then I began to notice several anomalies. I generally open Firefox in the morning when I open Gmail. Then I may open other tabs related or not to the mails I receive. I also open a weather tab, my bank account (that I keep logged in only when I need it), Wikipedia, IMDB (perhaps), and one or two others. So, at this point, I may have 6 or 7 tabs open. Then I generally minimize Firefox and work on Excel, Word, read some PDF documents or even play a Steam game. I use Avast antivirus and keep game mode open but I don't thing that it is related to the problem. After what may be 3 or 4 hours I click the Firefox icon on the taskbar. Generally it doesn't open immediately, or if it does I only see a blank window with no tabs visible. Then, very slowly and if I am lucky, the tabs began to appear but are not immediately visible. This process may take 30 or more seconds but then Firefox remains slow and sluggish. If I am not lucky Firefox purely stops responding for many seconds and it may or may not return to us. I tried some solutions, some of them I read in your foruns. Refresh Firefox improved the behaviour but didn't solve the problem. I cleaned the cache and most of the cookies, the same. I even tried using a config modification that changes the use of processes that appear on Task Manager, to only one. That also helped but didn't solve. Presently I am trying ESR but the problem remains. (there has been a slight improvement, but not much). I don´t use many add-ons (only 6) and I also tried restart Firefox with add-ons disabled. One last hint: when I notice the problem, that is when Firefox becomes lazy, the CPU occupation remains low (no more than 5 to 10%) and the memory around 25 %. Also, if I open Task Manager, it seems that the size of the various Firefox processes are slightly smaller then is usual. This seems logical but may be related. So, for the present I am out of solutions. Can you help? I would be most grateful. Thank you.  PS: my son works on a more powerful but older PC, and most of the time he has 20 or more tabs open for hours and hours, with no problem.

We already tried to install the Custom Tab Width extension in order to try making these changes, but got a message saying that the extension was incompatible with Firefox Quantum. Is that true with all of the Quantum packages. A relative of mine who is an avid computer user said I will probably have to wait until the next version of Firefox is released and then attempt the installation of the Custom Tab Width extension to see if it is compatible with that version. I don't understand why the default width settings cannot be changed with a simple process in the Settings or Preferences directories. I usually have my browser set up so that I can have more than 7 tabs or work spaces open and visible on the first screen, but since the default width is set to 100 pixels, I can only have 7 work spaces open and visible at one time. I have been using the Firefox web browser for the last 6 years, and have been pretty satisfied with it. The Firefox version I was using prior to the recent upgrade to 60 Quantum was already set to a much lower pixel number for the work spaces. Would also like to know if there is a way to hide search text in a browser tab when switching between work spaces.

We are allowed to use Firefox, but our IT department don't support it, actively discourage it's use, and do not test the company security proxy server with Firefox.  In the fine print of one internal support document they give a link to a certificate that allows Firefox to work, but this certificate has to be re-installed when Firefox is updated.
I am concerned that pretty soon I won't be able to use Firefox at all if Firefox doesn't work out how to work better with proxy servers.
Firefox needs to be able to load any website that IE can load (unless it uses flash and other malware).

<p>TL;DR- (still too long)
What: The tabs I haven’t used in a while randomly go blank. No tabs closed or created but the old tabs go blank. The icon is the tab’s original icon but the title is “New Tab” (actually, today when I tried opening a backup that already had all the old tabs blank, the title was blank with a blank description when you hover over it) and I can’t access the page that was supposed to be there . The curious thing is that they go blank like this (just an example, I have almost 400 tabs open lol) (numbers are tabs, zeroes are empty tabs and the tabs I actively use are 1,2,3):  
1 2 3|| 4 5 6 7 8 9  --&gt; 1 2 3|| 4 0 6 0 8 0 --&gt; 1 2 3|| 4 0 0 0 0 0 --&gt; 1 2 3|| 0 0 0 0 0 0 (first a group of even/odd tabs is hit, then the “blankness” seems to spread, maybe by itself, maybe when you open/close more tabs…kinda? I might’ve messed with it after the first proper restore (the June 15th backup+new tabs opened manually) by opening some of the tabs which would be affected, which might’ve protected them from the spread of the “blankness” of old tabs) (I hope you’re not as lost as I am.)
</p><p>This has already happened twice, first on June 15th and then on July 2nd. The first time (which happened without my noticing it) it was all even tabs after the 157th tab (I might’ve displaced the sequence by opening other tabs so I’m not sure if it was even or odd) and then (June 28th ) ALL tabs crashed, which is likely unrelated to this and maybe just a version/update issue, and were fixed with backups. However, the backup already had half of the old tabs blank. On June 29th (I think), all old tabs turned blank. When I noticed that, I restored to a backup from June 15th and reopened all the tabs that were missing (because they were from late June). 
</p><p>The second time, it was all even tabs after the 193rd tab (This time, I’m absolutely sure that those are the positions of the tabs that went blank, because I setup a batch script to backup sessionstore.jsonlz4 before then running FF). Later, it seemed to spread, but skipping a few tabs (not sure exactly when and if instantly), as tabs 200-206 are left untouched (Things were displaced, so now odd tabs are being hit and yeah, I opened a lot of tabs on the left side, so tab 193 became tab 200), while odd tabs between 186 and 200 are blank. It might’ve been because I opened some old tabs (not sure which) after the first proper restore, I have no idea. I think it only decided to kill the other half of the tabs after I noticed it and started freaking out (opening and closing FF to check information and to scrounge sessionstores while I write this). In those files, there are some (very few) random working tabs amidst the blank tabs, again maybe because I opened them?
</p><p>There is a noticeable file size reduction when the “blankness” hits hundreds of tabs but not when it’s just a few, I think.
</p><p>When: My guess is that it happens either when I close (I only recently found out you should close FF via the “Exit” option in the menu but I’ve never had this problem before!) or when I open FF.

<p>Official timeline-
I use FF beta (fake anime site blocker, google search link fix, historyblock, nano defender, noscript, personas plus, persona switcher, rikaichamp, ublock) (as of today, I’ve turned off all of those except for ublock, noscript, rikaichamp)[also use EMET 5.5] mostly to watch YT videos and I don’t actively use most of the tabs I have open (I have FF set to restore sessions) but I want them to always be available. Oh, and I have about 400 tabs open (but not loaded at all times, obviously), so I’m grateful that FF hasn’t irrecoverably self-destructed, but…
Edit: I also have EMET 5.5 running alongside FF. Is that known to cause problems?
</p><p>Around June 24th-June 27th, I had some hard to describe (rendering?) issues where text would (until I hovered over it, I think) be inside black boxes (Rikaichamp maybe? doesn’t matter) or just be random Unicode gibberish, I’m not sure.. However, I happened to accidentally open an old tab and noticed that it was blank. In addition to that, tabs started randomly crashing (they were all YT tabs, I think). I ignored all that, reopened the links in new tabs and continued browsing.
</p><p>Then, on June 28th, all of my tabs crashed (NOT the problem, bear with me). I think I tried restoring them but that didn’t work, so I looked inside [Profile folder]\sessionstore-backups and managed to find a recent backup. I also decided to downgrade from FF 62.0b3 to FF 61.0b9 (which is from the end of May, I think) and to turn off auto-updating to see if that helped. And it did fix the crashing/black boxes thing, probably. (I use this to peek inside the .jsonlz4 files <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html</a> by the way)
</p><p>But on June 29th , I realized that that random tab wasn’t the only one that had turned blank. In fact, all tabs I hadn’t touched in a while had turned blank. So, I opened up Windows System Restore to try to salvage my old tabs. I just ended up using the June 15th sessionstore and manually creating the tabs that weren’t in it (the scrounger helped a lot). The newest unaffected backup I have is from June 15th, and there’s an “upgrade” sessionstore (which I assume is created after an update, in this case presumably from 62.0b2 to 62.0b3) for that day but I also happen to have an unaffected “previous” sessionstore that was created after the “upgrade” one (and the tab corruption thing happened today again, without any updates), so I don’t think it’s the update’s fault.
</p><p>And today, June 3rd, as I was checking something out, I see that my (oldish) tabs have gone to tab hell again, except this time it randomly started yesterday, probably after I watched a YT video and closed FF. I don’t remember doing anything unusual. By the way, on June 1st I setup a batch script to backup my sessionstore every time I open FF so that I hopefully don’t lose it.
</p>
<hr>
<p>My question- Any ideas on what might be causing this? On a possible solution, hopefully? (I fear making a script to warn me when tabs go blank so I can fix it manually is not really a solution.) I think reloading all tabs could possibly help but considering there’s 400 of them, it’ll just crash the universe. I’ll help in any way I can. By the way, I might try restoring FF while backing up everything important but I still feel this is a problem which other people might be going through.

firefox 61.0 (probem has been ongoing for about 1.5 months though)
about 3000 bookmarks

</p><p>I found after investiagion that firefox has got stuck syncing. so: if I look at my sync wheel, its blue and will never stop spinning. If I close my browser, the firefox process doesn't quit and will hang indefinitely until Force Quit. When I restart, firefox has lost all browsing history and bookmarks changes i performed in the last session. Bear in mind here that, because I couldn't make any changes in Library and to get to the state where I can again means force quitting, that this means as soon as the problem hits, i've lost a way to retrieve any open tabs - they all have to be torn down and be lost! So its a serious problem. Its happening several times a day.
</p><p>It isn't happening every time firefox sync though - firefox can sync without getting stuck, it seems to happen WHEN i'm doing work with bookmarks (not necessarily in Library, can be though the dropdowns)

I also tested icloud with Edge, and any changes done on edge are synced successfully to the ipad / iphone.

</p><p>I'm using Firefox 61.0 on a Windows 8.1 tablet with no physical keyboard attached. And I would like the on-screen keyboard to stay visible all the time, no matter what. So I went to about:config and had ui.osk.enabled set to false, as was suggested by other support threads here. That stopped the on-screen keyboard from popping up automatically every time a text input field received the focus. That's good, but only halfway.
The problem is that the keyboard is still switched off every time I move from a text input field to some other place.
</p><p>For example, imagine me opening a new tab and typing ""<a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a>"" in the address bar. As soon as I hit 'Enter' the on-screen keyboard would disappear and I will be forced to turn it on again. That's very annoying because I need the keyboard on most of the time.
</p><p>What should I do to prevent Firefox from meddling with the on-screen keyboard?

1224501,1530729391,need help to make bookmarks side bar more visible,"<p>Been away from computer for quite a while, and, being a rather novice at ""changing"" things on the computer coupled with the fact I'm older than MOST of you nice folks, I need an easy, quick(if possible), and not too technical way to make the bookmarks sidebar a different color as my sight is limited at times. Right now the bookmarks have a white background and grey letters which make it hard to see where the bar that highlights the actual bookmark is...is that clear...? When you scroll down the list there is a VERY light grey bar that supposed to show you the current bookmark in use, but there is not enough contrast with the present colors to be easily visible.
</p><p>Any help would be HUGELY appreciated. I've tried doing searches all over, but most of them are out of date. I am running the very latest ver. of FF with the only add-ons being a Star Wars theme and Ad-Block and Bitwarden.

I saw this before but I thought that I was forgetting to add a folder when I bookmarked a page, but I'm now sure that the new bookmarks are losing the folder at an unspecified time.
I can't find any related info and can't create an account in bugzilla to report it.
Any help? Thanks.
</p><p>Update 1: I've disabled Test Pilot add-ons as mentioned below, and at first it seemed fine (I opened the Bookmarks sidebar all the time to watch them, and today they were exactly as I left them yesterday). Later, I was checking the bookmarks in my phone after syncing them and there were differences: a lot of bookmarks I had fixed yesterday now showed again in ""Other Bookmarks"" (only in the phone, they are ok in the PC); also, I created a subfolder and moved several bookmarks there in the desktop, but in the phone shows the folder empty and the bookmarks are in the previous outside folder (they still are ok in the PC). Another issue: I just came back to the PC and 2 pages I'd bookmarked yesterday with a folder lose it and are now in ""Other Bookmarks"".
I think that all of these issues are related to the Syncing process. At this moment, there are differences between the PC and the phone even if I manually sync both. It's messed up.

</p><p>Good Morning! 
</p><p>I would like to report Language Setting problem in my Mozilla Browser (version 61.0 (64-bit)) as follows.
</p><p>As shown in the screenshots, I have set the Language Setting to be “English” only, but when I open the Options menu on the Upper-left corner, the language is always showing “Indonesian”. And surprisingly, when I click on the menu Options -&gt; Settings, the window shows all instructions in English. But when I click on the Fonts setting for example, a popup will be shown in English for the Title Bar and the labels, however the Button’ labels are all shown in “Indonesian” (which is inconsistent).
</p><p>I have been comfortable in using Browser in English version and I had redownloaded the English Version of Mozilla Fireworks and re-installed it, but the problems still remain. I hope it will be fixed in the next release.
</p><p>Thank you for providing a great free product! I love Mozilla and I hope a better version will come soon.

Investigations, as in the article cited indicate  that the effect is related to our body clock, and is a problem with mobile phones and other digital devices.  In Venezuela  internet only functions somewhat acceptably between 10 PM and 8 AM, with occasional surprising periods in daytime.  When I don't  use the computer in the late afternoon and night I can sleep well, when I do I suffer miserable insomnia.   I have tried to put as much of the screen as possible, especially in Word, in tones of yellow instead of pure white, but it doesn't help much.

1224609,1530805495,Crazy problem about cookies,"<p>Hi all, I'm looking to solve an absurd problem about cookies with my 64bit Firefox installation.
I have for long time 5 different profiles in their respective customized paths, I launch them throught 5 shortcuts with -p flag; I mostly use 2 of them but the problem happens with all profiles.
</p><p>I have 3/4 websites that I visit frequently, when I open them it appears the cookie acceptance banner, I accept the policy and everithing runs without problems (or choice some customization settings in the websites).
When I close the browser and I switch profile, or simply restarting Firefox, it seems that cookies and settings of these 3/4 websites wouldn't save, and every time:
- the cookies banner of some sites appear, as if was never visited
- the settings of some sites aren't mantained (ex: the 3d auto-update of <a href=""http://4chan.org"" rel=""nofollow"">4chan.org</a>)
- the state of login of some websites aren't remembered  (ex: Instagram)
</p><p>The strange thing is that sometimes this problem doesn't happen, and I must restart FF more times to see it; another strange thing is that the problem occours only for these 3/4 websites, for the other hundreds of websites cookies and login session works regularly.
</p><p>I tried to:
- launch FF in safe mode without extensions 
- close the FF sessions through menu/exit
- do a research online/forums/etc and checked all possible misconfigurations
- delete the cookies of all the problematic websites
- delete cookies* files in the profile path
- delete and recreate the entire profiles 
- check profile paths user privilege
- run FF as administrator
- FF uninstall, manual clean of %userprofile% folders, reinstallation
</p><p>No results, mi FF seems cursed...
What else could I try?
Thanks,

</p><p>Chromium works fine, as well as IEX on my windows machine. If I start FF with firefox -P and use another unconfigured user it works.
</p><p>I really am tired of losing features like I lost prefbar in an earlier ""upgrade"", and my current cookie quick manager will be upgraded to the idiotic new version that REQUIRES that I verify that I have permission to delete cookies. Starting with a clean profile is less palatable than using Chromium, luckily it imported my bookmarks from FF which was previously a show stopper for using another browser. 
</p><p>So, as nebulous as this problem is to describe to y'all (screencap detail below) has anyone run into this issue and hopefully found a solution for it?

Well, Monday 75% of the machines updated, not all just most of them. I went around and re-installed 52.9 ESR on all of the effected machines, then Tuesday they updated again. So Yesterday, I went back to an older 51 ESR version, double checked it was set to never check, and verified that all the services were set to not update. I come into the office today and guess what... updated AGAIN!

Does your company plan to provide a suitable solution, such as an updated Add-On, a workaround, or are you never going to provide a solution?  This leaves me in a difficult place to complete my training.   Please advise.  Thank you.

1224784,1530910118,"Need a way to turn off add-ons (NOT one at a time, all at once!)","<p>Since Firefox is has become such a badly broken piece of garbage and seems to require constant troubleshooting nowadays, it would be nice if you included a way to quickly disable all addons at once, not one at a time, and not having to close down and restart — just a way to turn them off so I could make sure the problem is with the web page, or with Firefox being fundamentally broken, and not with one of my small handful of addons. The easier you make troubleshooting, the more time we can spend actually browsing the web and getting our work done. 
</p><p>For instance, if you're trying to buy a bus ticket, as I am right now, your time is much more productively spent actually buying the bus ticket, rather than wasting hours troubleshooting Firefox to try and figure out why the bus ticket website doesn't work in firefox when it works properly in every single other browser. Being able to turn addons on and off easily would help in this. I had thought opening a private window would turn the addons off for that window so I could go about my business and just get the consarned ticket bought, but after being unable to figure out how to make that happen I did some googling and it seems this feature was helpfully removed from newer versions of firefox. That would have been a nice thing to keep. Browsers with better features are better. Worse or missing features, not as good.

Thank you for being a valued DISH customer.""
</p><pre>It would be fine if it did this once. Or even once a day. But it does it numerous times a day. Limitless really. Because sometimes when ever you click to go to a webpage, wether it be from a bookmark or link on the page you're on, it will take you to the Dish page. Rendering internet access in large part unusable.  Because you could have a million redirects to the Dish page if you kept clicking. It happens at various times of the day and night. As well as lasts for various lengths of time, before temporarily going back to normal. Not sure why it does what when. Besides how Dish has it set and wont change it.
</pre>
<pre>Dish offers no fix. Basically they do this on purpose to try to annoy you enough to purchase more high speed. Which I dont want.
</pre>

1225004,1531080164,Why are Firefox developers stupid?,"<p>I've been using Firefox basically ever since it came out after Netscape died. It was a simple and flexible browser that promoted itself on the basis of respecting users and working hard to meet their expectations.
</p><p>Now, Firefox has broken most of the extensions I used with their Quantum crap and there is no hint of a backtrack despite widespread complaints and, I assume, mass exodus. The browser constantly nags users with bogus security warnings to the point its almost unusable depending on the website you visit -- of course, safe ones that have been opened forever with no issue. Now there's no option to disable javascript in the settings, being that js is a major security risk and many people might want to turn it off. All told, numerous cases of making life harder to users.
</p><p>Now, as if it weren't enough, Firefox is keeping my browsing history when I'm in a private window! Not only the URLs get saved on the address bar but the sites are also prominently displayed in the Highlights whenever a new window is opened! Congratulations on potentially ruining a bunch of marriages and causing all sorts of other problems to people who naively trusted Firefox to keep their private browsing... private!
</p><p>Goodbye, Firefox, I'm leaving to Opera until you guys get your shit together (hint: It starts by listening to users) if you ever do.  I advise everyone to do the same both to get rid of this train wreck of a browser and to protect your privacy. Unfortunately, the likely reaction from the developers will be that they are stubbornly right because they know what is best for us, even if everyone tells them otherwise. Enjoy the view from your ivory tower before it crumbles to the ground, suckers!
</p><p>PS.: The image upload thingy won't stop spinning and there's no indication the file was received despite my traffic monitor indicating the upload is done, once again showing how Mozilla systems are going downhill fast. So I changed the screenshot I was going to send to illustrate the privacy snafu to one that more closely reflects my feelings. I do hope it gets there and is seem by all developers.

1225049,1531107429,how do I keep bookmarks and other data separate between sign in IDs?,"<p>I created two different Firefox accounts and then logged into Firefox with each one, one at a time. In each case I made some bookmarks and turned on 'sync'. I could not find a method to switch accounts similar to Chrome; it appears I have to sign out of one ID and then sign into the other. So I did that, however, when I signed out of one ID and then into the next, all of the web sites I had logged into remained, and the bookmarks from the prior ID got merged into the second ID. Hmmmm??? I am trying to find a method to log into my accounts such as gmail, Amazon, etc with one ID and to create a set of bookmarks ie personal bookmarks that will stay tied to, and exclusive to, one Firefox ID. Then when I sign out of that firefox ID and into my second ID, such as for work purposes, to have a separate set of bookmarks and to NOT be automatically logged into my personal accounts. Is there a method to set up Firefox so that when going from ID 1 to ID 2 none of the history, logged in accounts, bookmarks, saved entries, etc will carry over? I'm trying to keep work / personal totally separate with distinct log-in IDs. I am aware of mutli-account containers but from what I can tell the data / history etc will all be viewable while logged into that Firefox ID so I do not think that will keep things separate enough. Any assistance is appreciated.

Figuring I probably won't need to configure these settings again, I checked ""remember these settings"" and hit OK.

</p><p>At this point, I figured the internet would have the answer. I can't find anybody who has mentioned this issue. The question: where do I go to change the video device or microphone device for Firefox AFTER I hit ""remember"" the first time? Or is hitting ""remember"" the kiss of death for being able to change these settings in the future? I searched Firefox settings: apparently the only settings relevant to mic/webcam are to allow or disallow those devices. Not what I want. An additional question: does Firefox just go directly to the default devices specified by Windows? Regardless of what I told it the first time? That might explain it. If this is the case, it's a major design flaw that it even asked me which devices to use the first time.

From my perspective, the reason why is because there's no audible or verbal confirmation of my selection. In the case of website notifications, I don't even seem to be able to ask Jaws to give focus to them using the keyboard at all. Also, sometimes (particularly the ""save this password"" notification) are read out by jaws multiple times and it's extremely annoying!

</p><p>I'm using Firefox 61.0.1 on a corporate network. To access SSL sites I need a specific CA certificate installed in Firefox (I don't know the technical details but it has something to do with content inspection). This has been working fine for years.
</p><p>Over the weekend some firewall-related changes were made (again, I don't know the specifics) but now I'm intermittently getting the dreaded SEC_ERROR_REUSED_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL error when trying to view SSL sites. I've deleted the various cert and key DB files (four in total) and reimported the CA certificate, but no luck.
</p><p>IE is fine, and apparently Chrome is fine, but Firefox isn't. I've heard from two other Firefox users who are having the same problem, so it's not just my machine.
</p><p>I suppose the most pertinent question is ""how do I find out which certificate is affected?"". I was assuming that it was our custom CA certificate, but I'm no longer certain. We removed the CA cert and tried using a ""PAN"" cert instead, but ended up with the same error. It would seem to indicate that the problem is elsewhere, but how do I find out where?

Menu being cut in half. 
Can be reset by toggling menu on and off, but it comes back.
Saw the reference to similar problem in 2017 question that was attributed to ""Tab Groups"" extension, but I do not have that ext. 
The only remotely related extension I have is Vertical Tabs. And although I love that extension, I actually had it disabled because I have been using Web Developer docked to the side for the last few days and the problem is still happening. So definitely not it. 
</p><p>Other than the super-duper Vertical Tabs, I have: Decentraleyes, Disconnect, Flag Fox, Font Finder, Google Search Link Fix, Nimbus, NoScript, Turn-off-the-lights, and U-Block Origin.  Pretty basic add-ons.
Theme is default, and no other ones loaded. (I'm very boring). 
Open264 and Widevine plugins only.
Images attached.
</p><p>As waiting for it to revert can take hours, it could take well over a week to test all of my extensions. So I figured I would check to see if anyone else had similar problems and figured something out.
</p><p>It's not a huge deal. Like I said, you can get it back simply by turning the menu off and on. But it does revert and it gets annoying as I do use the menu quite a bit, and I usually end up clicking on the tab instead of the menu item. So I always have to get it to its normal size.

For some reason or another, Internet Explorer stopped browsing to pages having SSL (https). I went to several web pages on the internet. They said this and that, but I managed to narrow it down to the SSL part. I recently received an update to Oracle Virtual Box, so that can also be the culprit. 
I also have another XP Professional English SP3 virtual machine with no additional software installed besides antivirus software, and in that machine, I had installed a pretty fresh version of Mozilla Firefox, so I tested it, and there was no problem at all surfing, but Internet Explorer refused to display the web page.
This is why I would like to have a link to the above mentioned version of Firefox, as you stated in another thread that that particular version was the last one to be supported by Windows XP.

1225492,1531397707,Firefox does not restore all windows with recent tabs,"<p>After updating to version 61.0.1 (64-bit) (Windows 7 64-bit) the session restore function does not work. I have several windows with lots of tabs, and all has gone. I tried to replace the backup js files in profile directory, but it does not solve the problem. So I tried to figure out, which functionality has the rpoblem. I opened a brand new session, opened three window with one-one different tab, and closed Firefox. After restarting, only one window was restored with the correct tab, the rest was opened with blank page. ""Restore All windows"" button also did nothing.
So the problem is with the restoring functionality during startup in the new version.

1225560,1531424033,LastPass logs out every time I open Firefox - LastPass claims it is a Firefox issue,"<p>I've had a ticket open with LastPass support since April 2018, about 100 days so far. This bug has occurred across ~7 LastPass versions and 2 major Firefox updates (Firefox 59, 60, and now 61).
</p><p>Steps to Reproduce:
</p><p>1. Install a fresh Firefox profile and install the LastPass extension.
</p>
<hr>wait four to six weeks----
<p>2. Open Firefox and ensure you are logged into LastPass.
</p><p>3. Restart Firefox.
</p><p>4. Upon opening Firefox, you are now logged out of LastPass.
</p><p>Expected result: you remain logged into LastPass. 
</p><p>And shockingly, it happens on both of my systems at about the same time! They are on the same Firefox login and LAN, for what it is worth.
</p><p>I want to emphasize: no settings are changed inside LastPass throughout these four weeks, 2FA has been authenticated (and always set to ""Remember this device""), and LastPass' settings for auto-logout are all fully disabled--this is all evidenced by continuously being logged in for 4 to 6 weeks. The bug occurs every few weeks with no solution except to create a new Firefox profile. 
</p><p>Even now, my current profile has become 'corrupted'. I can make a new profile and the extension works perfectly: restarting Firefox does not affect the logged in/out status. It's only this current profile. I'm at wits end here, but I'm unsure how to file a bug report as there is no clear STR: the bug simply appears every few weeks. I've now gone through two cycles of this bug. :(
</p><p>What we've tried so far:
</p><p>1. Reinstalling Firefox.
</p><p>2. Removing and adding the LastPass extension.
</p><p>3. Removing all other extensions. 
</p><p>4. Uninstalling and reinstalling the binary component (required for some LastPass features)
</p><p>5. Ensuring LastPass cookies are being stored.
</p><p>Nothing above worked, until we tried creating a fresh profile, which works instantly. However, having done it twice now, I've lost a lot of data between new profiles (history, cookies, bookmarks, site preferences, dictionary, and interface layout). 
</p><p>LastPass has seemingly given up now and claims I should now contact Firefox because if a new profile fixes it, it somehow is now a Firefox issue. Does anyone have suggestions, besides changing browsers?

</p><p>I have also set one of the headers in the Page Setup of Firefox to 'Date/Time' and have noticed that when I print a page, Firefox does not take into consideration my regional settings, but uses a standard format instead.
</p><p>For example, the header is '6/25/2018 11:48 PM'. If the format in my regional settings where followed, the header should be '25-06-2018 23:48'.
</p><p>I do not know if this is standard behavior or should be reported in order to be fixed. Would anyone please lend a helping hand?
</p><p>Thank you very much.
</p><p>All the best,
John
</p><p>PS: Just for reference, Thunderbird follows the regional settings format, when printing.

1225780,1531576378,Updated to 61.0.1 and lost all bookmarks,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>There was a pending update for Firefox for the last week or so (work computer, I don't restart browser every day). This morning I needed to restart my computer for another reason, and the update to 61.0.1 processed (I'm not 100% what version I was on before, either 60 or 61 - is there a way to check?).
</p><p>After the update, the Bookmarks toolbar was present, but blank.
</p><p>I checked the Bookmarks Library and saw that there were many automatic backups (Import and Backup -&gt; Restore).
</p><p>However, most of them (including all the recent ones) were only 183 Bytes in size, and said ""One Item"". The only backups that were different were extremely old backups (One from ***April of 2017***- 8.5KB and 99 items, and two from February 2017, with similar numbers).
</p><p>I was able to restore the old April 2017 backup, but it's over a year out of date, and is missing *MANY* bookmarks from the past year.
</p><p>I also tried to manually import a backup from the AppData/Roaming profile folder (path: C:\Users\mwood\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\0xeukaki.default\bookmarkbackups) but it only shows the bookmark files being 1KB (183 Bytes if I look at file properties), except very old 2017 backups from February 2017.
</p><p>I picked a most recently backup at 1KB, and it did nothing.
</p>
<ul><li>note: images were taken after restoring the April 7, 2017 backup, so ignore the *most recent* backup, since it's just a recent backup of those April 7, 2017 bookmarks*
</li></ul>
<p>I have not installed any new plugs recently, or otherwise made any changes to Firefox aside from the recent update.
</p><p>What's going on? How can I recover my bookmarks from last week.
</p><p>Thanks,
Michael

1225904,1531684088,Firefox adds history,"<p>For some reason, whenever I close firefox and shut the pc down, then restart it again, firefox adds some history to my browserhistory.
For example. I started watching a series, I was at season 11, episode 11, 2 days ago. Yesterday when I launched my pc, the history page for season 11, episode 11, was added after the season 12 episodes I watched, and the page that got loaded was the season 11, episode 11 page.
I checked my history to see where I was (season 12 episode 9) and continued from there. Today it's once again at season 11, episode 11, and that page has once again been added to my history as latest page visited...
Why does it keep going back to season 11, episode 11? How come it keeps adding that line to my history? Checking my history everything else is fine, except that 1 stupid tab that keeps adding a line in history and then jumps to that page. (luckily only on restart but its still annoying as fuck)
The weirdest part to me is that my history isn't deleted or wrong or anything, the only thing that's wrong is that 1 page, that keeps being added as the latest page visited in my history, which is why it keeps getting loaded on startup:S
All other tabs work fine... seeing as I'm watching a serie through streaming, it would be nice if I could just continue where I was instead of having to look in my history everyday and then change it.

To answer your questions:
1. Yes there is a folder on my desktop labeled Old Firefox  Data.
2. After I did the refresh the Firefox shortcut was no longer working.  I then used Opera so I could get on the Internet. When I tried to use the shortcut for Firefox the print screen attached came up. 
3. The adobe files I was trying to load are several weeks and/or months old. I believe most of them were downloaded from another site and converted to pdf during the download. They are stored in my directories/libraries I have opened these files prior to the problems I am having now.

1225943,1531707632,How to STOP Firefox from updating older versions even when set to NOT auto update in Preferences!,"<p>Okay,
</p><p>Two parts to this issue....
1: Part One - Snagit Plugin Autoscroll Helper - the reason I need an older version of Firefox available
2: Part Two - Part one will only work if Part Tow can be retained on older version.
</p><p><br>
I use a plugin tool called SNAGIT autoscoll helper by TechSmith (or rather used to). 
The latest Firefox does not support one of the it's primary features, this stopped working approx 2 years ago and Mozilla have disabled it being installed on current versions . TechSmith are just as disengaged and do nothing to resolve or provide an alternative for MAC on any browser.
</p><p>I thought if I could install two versions of Firefox the latest plus a legacy version (so I can simply autoscoll web page capture), I MAY be able to somehow limp through life in this less that okay way.
</p><p>Technically the following suggestion works. <a href=""https://www.haykranen.nl/2011/08/04/howto-run-multiple-versions-of-firefox-side-by-side-on-mac-os-x-lion/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.haykranen.nl/2011/08/04/howto-run-multiple-versions-of-firefox-side-by-side-on-mac-os-x-lion/</a>
</p><p>BUT (the big BUT)...even though I download version v50.0 (which allows the plugin) and set to 'not' autoupdate. I get everything running, as soon as I close the older version of Firefox and relaunch it does what it likes and updates this old version to v57.0...this is so not cool!
</p><p>How do I prevent this and how can I get multiple versions functioning? I have left messages on TechSmiths  site as well but as the two seems to be blaming each other for the disconnect...maybe someone in the community has a work around?
</p><p>Ideas greatly appreciated....and Mozilla if there is 'anything' you can do to get the plugin reinstated and integrated with your latest version, that would be fantastic!
</p><p>Thanks

</p><p>I have a requirement where when a User requests a URL, a custom Pop Up asking for User Name and Password has to be shown.
Currently, the default Pop Up asking for User Name and Password which is provided by the Firefox pops up and then our custom Pop Up comes on top of it.
</p><p>So, how can we disable or surpass the default browser pop up using Java script or any webRequest API methods.
Tried a few options:-
</p><p>1. Request status to 200 for every request
This is impractical and not possible scenario
</p><p>2. Change the Authentication Header on the Server
Before posting the data to the server, Pop Up comes and hence this also won't help.

Please disregard this question, I apologize for wasting anyone's time.
</p><p>For some reason, a lot of my downloads end up with strange names and without a file extension. For example:
</p><p>If I try to save a PDF file from my university with the following link.
<a href=""https://mylo.X.edu.au/d2l/le/content/235142/topics/files/download/2789744/DirectFileTopicDownload"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mylo.X.edu.au/d2l/le/content/235142/topics/files/download/2789744/DirectFileTopicDownload</a>
the file gets saved as ""DirectFileTopicDownload"" (that is part of the link, it has not been replaced or changed like the X has).
</p><p>Alternatively, when I try to download executable files, often I end up with a string of numbers and letters which Im fairly certain is related to the files in question, though I can't tell how ( a quick google search of the string tends to lead to a related site etc.). FOr example, when trying to download a companion app for the firefox extention VideoDownloadHelper, i get the extension-less file ""c036135a-7faa-11e8-87ad-cc9be00dd6d8""
