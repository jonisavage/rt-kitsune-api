</p><p>In Firefox 63 the option to never check for updates was removed. The release notes suggest to create a policies.json to disable updates. This does not result in similar behaviour! It does indeed stop the checks for updates, but it also disables the option of manually checking for updates. So this is not the same!
</p><p>I'd like to know how I can disable the auto checking for updates, but keep the option to manually check and update.

</p><p>I typically check for updates every few days, but I do not want Firefox to check automatically and/or install without my express permission.  I seem to be left with renaming the policies file every time I want to check for updates. Cumbersome and very user unfriendly.
</p><p>I would like to get back to the behaviour I have used for many years. To wit: I click on 'About Firefox' and I can see the version number without any checks or updates starting without my consent. I am presented with a button to check for updates. If I click it, I am presented with either a message stating I am up to date, or an option to update without it automatically doing so. And only if I then click to confirm that I indeed want to update, it starts downloading said update and installing it. This is what I want back please. How do I make that happen? Thanks.

</p><p>Firefox has begun showing a strange behavior in the last week and a half - The rendering engine or whatever randomly decides that what's on the window is ""too wide"" and turns the entire window black until the window size is shrunken to its ""happy width"", at which point everything displays as normal instantly.  Restretching even one pixel beyond this width returns the window to black.  Bookmarks sidebar shows as solid white under this condition. Nothing is immune from the Black Window syndrome when it happens, even the preferences and addons tabs.  
</p><p>Later on,  Firefox will again spontaneously decide its window is too wide again and go black until the window is shrunken again.  Disabling extensions and add ons has no effect.  I've used Safe Mode to restart FF a few times and reset the width but of course all my preferences and extensions have to be reset.  I'm down to only being able to use half my screen width for the window size today due to it occurring four times just today.  Trying to capture a screenshot gets only a file of a white image, and strangely no drop-down bar at the top even though ""live"" it always shows.  Could this be a quirk in OSX?

1238031,1540338808,Firefox options page home page not editable  (dropdown does not drop down),"<p>I've been helping my 88-year-old father with his PC.  He has Windows 7, Firefox 63, and I'm trying to get it to stop updating because every time it does, it resets things - lately it's been asking him for his Firefox password, but he doesn't use any server-based Firefox features, so it's only causing confusion.  He does NOT need to log onto Firefox sync. 
</p><p>While I was fixing his settings, I noticed he had his home page set to Facebook, whereas previously, I had set it to the Firefox default for him (""New Tab"" still uses the default Firefox page).  When I clicked on the dropdown to change from ""Custom URLs"", nothing dropped down, and I was unable to change the home page.  Eventually, I reset all of his settings to default and restarted.  Then he told me he actually did want Facebook for his home page, and now I couldn't set it back - clicking on the dropdown to change from ""Default"", again, nothing dropped down.  I googled and found another way to change the home page by dragging a tab to the house icon on the page, and that worked, but I do not understand why I am not able to change the home page setting using the options page.
</p><p>Note: I have been fiddling with adding a policies.json file to try to prevent unwanted prompts for Firefox sync password and unwanted prompts for updating the browser.  On the thought that that might have been causing a problem, I removed the line that disables update checks, but that didn't make any difference.

When attempting to change my theme in the customize window, mousing over the Default theme does show the proper colors for it, but selecting it still shows the Dark theme colors. I tried examining my Add-ons manager, where it shows that I am still using the Default theme, despite the colors clearly belonging to the Dark theme. I can freely change to the Light theme without issue, but for some reason, the Default one refuses to load properly. I have since tried uninstalling all my Add-ons, deleting my profiles, and uninstalling Firefox before restarting my computer, but to no avail. The Add-on I was examining initially was the Dark Night Mode add-on. Examining the page info, it does say it is not perfect, and their home page says that there are complex issues with getting it to work with Firefox, but I was unable to find more information on this offhand, nor any descriptions of scenarios like mine. I believe the initial settings for my Default theme came from some setting based off my color scheme I have set for my computer themes in general, based off my background, but I was unable to find more information on this at the time. The screenshots I am including are of my Add-on manager showing that I am using the default theme, the customize menu showing the Default theme when highlighted in the drop down menu to change it, and the result that displays when the Default theme is selected. Any ideas on why this issue is occurring, and how to fix it, would be appreciated.

And the ""Show Sidebars"" icon is glued to my toolbar (the one with the URL &amp; search fields). Whenever I go to Customize and drag it out of there to the Customize box, where the unused icons live, it reappears every time I close and reopen Firefox. BUG.
</p><p>One piece of advice on the Forum from 8/8/18 says to ""Right-click a bookmark and choose Properties, then check in the lower left corner for a checkbox to ""Load this bookmark in the sidebar"" and uncheck that box."" I have no such checkbox on  the bookmarks I've right-clicked, so I obviously can't uncheck it. Besides, this would require looking at every bookmark - grossly impractical.
</p><p>The other advice on 8/8/18 also doesn't work. It says to rename or remove xulstore.json in the Firefox profile folder. Doing this makes Firefox open without remembering much of anything. This is going after a fly with a sledgehammer.

after updating my FF from 62.03 to 63.0, I experience a strange behaviour. I use the css properties ""display:none""  and ""display:table-cell"" to dynamically show and hide table columns. Prior to FF 63.0 everything worked excellent. But now, after hiding columns (by altering the css property form ""display:table-cell"" to ""display:none""), the table and its content is displayed properly but some of the cells are missing their defined background colour. As soon as doing some action which forces a redraw of the window (e.g. resize the window or scroll the window), the complete table is diplayed properly . In order to give an impression feel free to have a look at the attached images Pre-Collapsed-Table.png, Collapsed-Table.png and Expected-Collapsed-Table.png. Meanwhile I have been playing with the ""visibility"" attribute in order to get the desired result. Unfortunately this is not suitable because hidden elements take up space on the page.
</p><p>Is it a bug in FF 63.0? What can I do to get the previous and expected behaviour? Any ideas?

Color primaries: BT.709.

</p><p>Since the most recent update I am experiencing problems in being able to save pictures. I find an image in Google Image Search, click on it and go to save .... however it does not save. The process even prompts me to select the folder I want it saved in, the name I want to give the file and so on. I do all of these things - but there is no picture there when I go to the folder. I have tried saving to different folders but no luck. This does not happen in all cases, only on some pictures.
</p><p>I find the only way i can save the picture is to click on View Image and then prompt it to save. However as my work involves finding lots of images online, this is adding several steps to the process. It is also annoying when I have to save 50+ pictures and then go back and find that maybe half-a-dozen or so are not there

I followed some instructions I found online that told me to tick the option for it under Options -&gt; General -&gt; Startup, and this fixed the problem.

</p><p>If I tick off the option to automatically restore my previous session, however, I do get a warning that tells me I'm about to close my browser, but it only gives me the options to close tabs and cancel closing my browser; the option to save &amp; quit is absent entirely.

- Since then Firefox won't ask if I want to save my tabs so I have to manually restore previous session every time. ShowQuitwarning is set ot be enabled. I tried deleting/renaming sessionstore.js and prefs.js
- When I restored ShowQuitwarning it says it isn't a boolean, but a string variable. I assume something got corrupted, by have no idea what and how to restore besides a full reinstall? (In the meantime the option seems to have vanished fully, it is not present in about:config)

This would not allow a website to pop up save dialogs and other dialogs preventing you from closing the tab.  Honestly with the current architecture of applications I am not sure this is possible if the dialog is modal.  
</p><p>So I guess is there any kind of emergency mechanism to prevent this kind of thing already?  I have pop ups blocked in Firefox settings.  I just have never seen a someone abuse the save file dialog like this.

After 5-8 seconds Firefox starts to load the page and then it goes very fast.
This makes it impossible to use Firefox, because normal activities take a lot of time, because every click takes 5-8 seconds. On chrome on the same PC everything is OK.

As website owner my convern comes after mozilla is blocking tracking by default meaning that google ads cannot be served by default, only if users will choose so. Most of the mozilla users don't even know what tracking means, so the chances of choosing to allow tracking and serve ads are very low.
Many websites owners use adsense ads to pay for their servers/hosting, their hard work, etc. and as you know every visitors is comsuming resources and bandwidth, so my questions is: Why webmasters shouldn't block mozilla users since the chances to generate revenue thru ads is very low, to none?
I get that it's a great feature to the user, but should be an option rather than a default setting?

It is absolutely not my computer's problem since I'm enjoying the normal video playback that I was before, only on Chrome. With internet speeds of 20 Ping, 92.96 Mbps download, and 15.82 Mbps upload, I know it's not suddenly my connection.

It just started closing upon minimization this morning. How do I get it back to how it was? I will have to use a different browser if there is no fix for this and I really don't want to do that.
I should also add that Firefox had been pinned to my taskbar. This morning it was gone and I had to re-pin it there. But it doesn't matter whether I open it from the taskbar or from the menu, it shuts down when I minimize. 
Please help!
I also just noticed that even if I don't minimize it, if I do anything else on my computer it closes and I have to completely restart it. I absolutely can't work this way. For example, if I leave it open and then open my Word document, when I try to go back to Firefox it has closed and has to re-start. All the information I just researched is gone. I'm very, very frustrated.

It seems to be limited to installation of ESR-60 (and above) on Windows platforms.  
With ESR-52.9 (and older) the files which I placed into ""Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\prefs\local-settings.js"" and ""Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\mozilla.cfg"" are able to make settings and lock preferences.  The settings which I used in the files are similar to those listed by shekpal.  When I use the same files, in the same locations with ESR-60 (and above) installed on Windows 7 or Windows 10: I open about:config and same the settings are either listed as ""user set"" or ""default"" and can be changed.  That is not desired behavior.  
I have also placed the same files into installation of ESR-52.9 and ESR-60 (and above) on Linux installations (as ""/usr/lib64/firefox/mozilla.cfg"" and ""/usr/lib64/firefox/defaults/preferences/local-settings.js"") and the locked behavior is as desired--about:config shows the settings as locked.
I followed the steps in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-autoconfig"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-autoconfig</a> to completely reset and used the names of autoconfig.js and firefox.cfg.  I ensured that the first line was a comment.  Nothing restored the desired functionality on a Windows system.
An additional anomaly which I did find is that if I have  ""Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\prefs\local-settings.js"" in place without the referenced mozilla.cfg file in place gives these results:
Firefox 52.9-ESR displays an error that preferences cannot be found and closes.  That is expected behavior.
Firefox 60.3-ESR opens without displaying an error.

The only way I've found to do it so far is to use Task Manager to ""end task"" and then when I bring it back up make sure I remember to tell it to restore the lost tabs.

Concurrently, is there a way to allow a ""tracking cookie"" if I need it to retain information for a site I'm comfortable with?

</p><p>The Mozilla info screen for ""Zotero Autoexporting"" displayed ""Not compatible with FireFox Quantum"".
</p><p>I have either asked the wrong question about or looked in the wrong place for a functional extension of the Zotero utility and its use with Firefox Quantum and LibreOffice, or FireFox Quantum does not support a usable LibreOffice Zotero extension or connector (I do not know the difference between these two).
</p><p>Having downloaded FireFox Quantum following many, many attempts to configure these named applications / to download the correct application versions / to correctly configure the applications / to troubleshoot incorporating PubMed bibliographic citations using Zotero into LibreOffice 6.1.2.1 documents, to finally read that the Zotero extension is  ""Not compatible with FireFox Quantum"" is massively frustrating.
</p><p>Here is what I want to do:
</p><p>Use the browser Firefox Quantum.  Install into FireFox Quantum an auto-downloading Zotero extension.  Perform PubMed searches. Use Pubmed resources to save searches in a format Zotero can import.  Use Zotero to import and manipulate PubMed-Zotero compatible search results.  Incorporate search results from Zotero into LibreOffice Writer documents.

At the end of the survey that took about 20-35 minutes, it asked for my email so that they can send me a $5 Amazon Gift Card. I completed this on the 24th.
The website in question where I filled the firefox survey at was, ""<a href=""http://forthrightsurveys.com"" rel=""nofollow"">forthrightsurveys.com</a>""
Returning to the website (specifically the last page right when I submitted my email, ""<a href=""http://forthrightsurveys.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">forthrightsurveys.com/</a>[whole bunch of strings]) gives the prompt 
""This questionnaire has already been completed using your ID. It may only be completed once be each respondent.""
Going to <a href=""http://forthrightsurveys.com"" rel=""nofollow"">forthrightsurveys.com</a> url in general links me specifically to ""<a href=""http://intellisurvey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">intellisurvey.com</a>"", so I can't check to see if I might have put my email wrong.
</p><p>I have been checking my inbox and my junk mail just in case but I have still not received an email. Is there anyway to get my giftcard or to be able to redo the survey in order to be able to get my giftcard? I have tried to check the firefox website for support in general as to who to email in regards to this, but all it leads to is back to this forum to ask my question.

After reading from various malware forums it appears that <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a> has links to crypto mining software and as well as the notorious <a href=""http://conhive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">conhive.com</a>. Firefox does not attempt to connect to any other website apart from <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a>. When firefox starts on my laptop it creates 4 processes. One parent/main process and 3 child processes. All the 3 processes try to connect to <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a> website. Starting the firefox in safe mode or after resetting it still leads to the same behaviour. Only firefox exhibits this behaviour when I try to launch it and when I shut it down. Other browsers do not. 
</p><p>So my question is as follows
1) How do I determine which process or what setting or the location of the infection that is causing Firefox to connect to <a href=""http://cnhv.co?"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co?</a>
2) How do I fix this? How do I clean Firefox such that it does not connect to any crypto website at startup and shutdown?

When I double click in the top bar of the firefox browser, any open windows are put away, not closed...which destroys the link, but put away like clicking on the minus sign in the upper right blue bar that is next to the ""fill page"" icon and the red X that destroys the link.
This may be a property of MS8.1 POS or it might be Firefox. I am sick and tired of having to open all these windows one by one each time my finger ""stutters"" producing a rapid double click. I have tried changing single click and double click response delays, but that does not help either. The morons that wrote MS8.1 load the keystrokes instantly without checking timing. 
Also, does anyone know of an operating system that emulates the MS NT system without all the F------ ""features"" that pervade later OSes??? Many Thanks for your suggestions!!!

If a person has hacked firefox browser, will that let them see one's browsing history? Websites,  email questions?
i have changed my firefox password, and I'm pretty good at changing other often-used passwords, and good at creating difficult nonsensical passwords.  But I have had my email hacked etc. like many people in the world.
</p><p>I received a spoof email, the first I ever saw from my email to me, on Oct 25. That is not unusual that people do that, but the email had information that only someone who would have seen recent browsing. I just want to be safe as possible. What settings can I use in options that will cut down on tihs? Because today, I saw two more spoof emails (using my email) It was not from my email -- it was missing information -- but still annoying).

1238564,1540740674,Firefox Quantum Uses an excessive amount of ram for Addons,"<p>recently ever since upgrading to Firefox Quantum i have noticed a huge RAM issue and after looming around forums for many months gathering different viewpoints on this problem i feel like the issue is most likely being caused by the new addon handling protocols, once you disable every single addon you will notice firefox uses about 80% less ram, the problem isnt that i have too many addons even with a single addon enabled the RAM usage dramatically increases i personally only use an adblocker and google translator very lightweight addons for any other version of firefox until it hits Quantum, and no i dont use 100 tabs in a single session... i normally use like 2-3 tabs and have only about 8 tabs only max, but if that doesn't convince you at mozilla that Quantum has horrible addon handling take this into your figures Quantum without addons idles on a fresh restart at about 400mb RAM usage but once you enable an addon that number jumps up to about 500-600mb and every addon enabled after that compounds the usage issue
</p><p>this wasn't a problem with firefox until quantum was introduced, and from what i hear about the firefox quantum the addon handling was changed to disallow addons access to specific browser system files that some addons were  using that caused firefox to crash,
</p><p>feel free to correct me if i'm wrong but “Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” iv eliminated all the other probable causes and the changes to the addon handling is all that remains

1238569,1540742694,Firefox is no longer capable of doing many of the things that made it great,"<p>I know the support forum isn't the best place for this, but I really don't know how else to get people's thoughts on this. I get the impression the Devs have no idea how or why some people use Firefox.
</p><p>I've been using Firefox on and off before it was even at version 1.0. When I started working at a big company in 2008 with a locked-down IT policy, Firefox had me 100% covered, and did everything I could ever dream of wanting it to do.
</p><p>In the last year or two, key features that always made it a winner have slowly been disappearing, and now it has gotten to the point that it is actually barely any better than IE11, and no different than Chrome. Why? Big reason is now addons don't work, or can't work the way they used to/need to, but it goes beyond that.
</p><p>1. I can no longer have my homepage open, when I load a new tab. This is absolutely mind boggling, even internet explorer can do that! NOTE: My homepage is a webpage saved on my harddrive that I made that gives me quick access to everything I need to do for work. I used to be able to load it natively, then it became something that required an add-on, and now it is completely broken, and impossible to do.
</p><p>2. Devs clearly don't understand the concept of a PROXY. Lots of people (i.e. in corporate environments) have everything go through a proxy. I can't even use the firefox installer anymore (as I discovered yesterday) because it requires a direct connection to the internet.
</p><p>3. Speaking of Proxy issues, when I open firefox, it immediately needs to connect to the internet, resulting in proxy authentication pop-ups. These used to be Auto-accepted with the addon AUTO-AUTH, however with the new web API crap this apparently isn't possible. There are settings in firefox that are supposed to auto-accept proxy-logins, but they don't work. So - I'm stuck hitting enter every single time I open the bloody program. There is no way to delay or stop firefox from automatically trying to connect to the internet which is also stupid.
</p><p>4. I could go on, but what's the point... the Devs don't care. Time to go back to FF v51 or whatever version it was before things went so wrong and hang on to that, with my windows 7 installation. Sigh.

As far as I can tell I can't tell Firefox, when starting, to make sure the Ask to save logins and passwords for websites is checked but could such a thing be possible?  This would allow me to add a command line when I start firefox on startup.  How about ""Ask to save logins and passwords for websites = 1"" or, say, add a line like that to the profile page?  (that might even be better and then the profile file could become kindofa ini file for users.)

Where the different pref commands were used and the files locations was the problem. I couldn't use lockPref in the user.js file, I couldn't use the user_pref in the mozilla.cfg file. I was hoping to combine the commands together but it wouldn't work. So, here is what I came up with, spelled out clearly as to how it is setup. Almost every place I found on the internet would not have all the information spelled out leaving me scratching my head as to what they were trying to say. Here is the procedure I put together:
</p><p>Mozilla Firefox version 63.00 Setup for Locking Files
</p><p>1.	Open Firefox and type “about:config” into the path bar.
</p><pre>       a.	For any preference that is locked you will see the entries in italics and the status displaying “locked”
</pre>
<p>2.	Create the following as text files and change the extension on each.
</p><pre>       a.	mozilla.cfg – lists desired files to be locked.
               i.	The first line is always a double forward slash (//)
               ii.	Starting at the second line, use the lockPref command – examples:
                     1.	lockPref(""app.update.enabled"", false);
                     2.	lockPref(""security.tls.version.min"", 2);
      b.	local-settings.js – uses mozilla.cfg to lock the preferences. 
              i.	Add the following entries. Do NOT place a “//” on the first line of the file.
                     1.	pref(""general.config.filename"", ""mozilla.cfg"");
                     2.	pref(""general.config.obscure_value"", 0);
      c.	user.js – changes the settings for each of the listed preferences.
              i.	Enter the same entries that were in mozilla.cfg but use the “user_pref” command at the beginning of 
                       each entry. Do NOT place a “//” on the first line of the file.
                    1.	user_pref(""app.update.enabled"", false);
                    2.	user_pref(""security.tls.version.min"", 2);
</pre>
<p>3.	The folders where mozilla.cfg and local-settings.js files are located have full Administrators and System rights assigned, however to make changes to these files copy them to another folder (i.e. Desktop) then copy it back into its respective folder. The UAC prompt asks to accept the changes. A regular user shouldn’t have rights to do this.
</p><p>4.	Location is very important for each of the above files. Place each in their respective directories as shown below.
</p><pre>       a.	mozilla.cfg is placed into:
               i.	C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox
       b.	Local-settings.js is placed into:
               i.	C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref
       c.	User.js is placed into:
               i.	C:\Users\”username”\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*this folder name will vary for each installation*
</pre>
<p>5.	To disable the files listed in mozilla.cfg, open the local-setting.js file and add “//” to the beginning of each line to remark them out, save and then restart Firefox. Verify in Firefox under “about:config” that the “locked” status was removed. Of course, to lock them again, remove the “//”.
</p><p><br>
My question now stands as when GPO is set up to push, is it these three files pushed to their respective locations  for each roaming profile and computer?

I am not in ""full screen"" view (already tried F11 to be sure).

I've gone into customize and removed and then re-added the ""bookmarks menu"" but it only shows up next to the other icons, not in the normal ""toolbar"" format with my folders, etc.  I can view my bookmark toolbar in the SIDEBARS but again it's just the top of my screen that's messed up and I know it has something to do with my min/maximize buttons being overlapped with tabs but can't get out of it.

</p><p>I have a website that has links to download Adobe DRM files (.acsm).  In Chrome, Internet Explorer and Edge when you click the file button it downloads an .acsm file and opens in Adobe Digital Editions.  In Firefox v63.0 it opens as an xml page in the browser.
</p><p>I've checked the Firefox Applications Settings and I don't have .acsm listed as a file type so can't change the Application type and Firefox is not prompting me to add .acsm and select an action when I click on the button so I don't have a chance to set a file type action either. I have already reset Firefox back to default and that made no difference.  
</p><p>I can't work out why other browsers on devices I've tested on download this file correctly but Mozilla doesn't - I hoping someone here can tell me and point me in the right direction for a fix!

1238780,1540886603,Working around lack of accessibility implementations.,"<p>Considering Mozilla has an article regarding this: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility</a>
I am unsure why they themselves fail on basics like re-bind-able keys and adjusting font sizes within their mainline products.
</p><p>Relying on someone else to write an extension to provide accessibility features, for a product developed by a proponent for accessibility on the web - just boggles the mind. More so that all those extensions have been broken with recent updates - leaving a gap where people like me lose the ability to use Firefox properly.
</p><p>So every day it seems like I find some bananas issue that I have to fix. Today, it's the fact that someone at Mozilla thought binding / to a hotkey that steals focus from your input to drop you into some specialized search tool. 
I don't really care what 'quic kfind' does, I dislike right now on the principle that it shouldn't be activated by a plain key press, especially one that is used for developer apps and DIVISION.
One might as well have bound 'select all' to the 'A' key - was there some reason this couldn't have been CTRL-/, much like other common hotkeys like say... 'select all'?
</p><p>But yes I brought up accessibility, and I use a keyboard just fine - if not better. My issue is I have problems with vision, and as there is no option to change font scale for Firefox itself, on larger resolution monitors I struggle to read text on the UI. So I was a bit peeved that I needed to write CSS to do what other apps have an options in their settings for, or some hot (VS Code as several in fact, and they are RE-BIND-ABLE as well). Even better that it's buried in %AppData% - a folder typical users don't even know exists. Luckily I have little issue getting this working on my own... but why? I am not a 'Firefox developer' nor do I write Firefox extensions - so why do I need to muck around with it's files  as if I was one, just to get it to do basic things like this? Stop relying on 3rd parties to add in features like this for you.
</p><p>These problems have been solved time and again elsewhere in other programs, by other companies - usually as convenience to the average user - yet they are important for people who depend on such features to accomplish daily tasks.
</p><p>So why is it that Mozilla of all companies, has failed to do what they say other developers and designers should do?
</p><p>So anyways - what file do I need to edit to change hotkeys now? Evidently Quantum broke every extension that addressed this and I can't find anyone who's fixed theirs yet.

Adding the following code as ""extra CSS"" to the Wordpress theme is the only thing that fixes it:
</p><p>html {
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
font-smoothing: antialiased;

I've troubleshooted by clearing my caches, disabling the few plugins I have installed and switched to different WP themes by different developers but the problem persists. I tried changing FF settings too... disabling plugins and add-ons, switched themes and turned off hardware acceleration to no avail. It should be noted I don't notice this on random sites I visit, just these that I've created using Wordpress. Checking another site I created by hand coding the Google fonts render fine.

1238893,1540971589,How do I turn off autocomplete?,"<p>Simple question: How do I turn off autocomplete in the search bar?
</p><p>Autocomplete is the function which inputs text I did not type into the text box. Autocomplete is not the dropdown beneath the search bar, that is automatic suggestions. Autocomplete is not the feature that fills out forms, that is autofill. Autocomplete has nothing to do with storing browsing history or any other information. It is not a security feature, it is a usability feature. I do not want to turn off automatic suggestions, autofill, cookies, history tracking, or any other information storage or usability functions. I only want to turn off autocomplete. Please tell me how to turn off autocomplete, and only autocomplete. I shouldn't have to go into detail like this but I know from past experience that it can take literally weeks to wade through the endless mis-directions to finally get to an answer that actually addresses autocomplete. So do not respond by telling me anything about shutting off any other features, or I will report your post for spam.
</p><p>I quit Google Chrome and switched to Mozilla Firefox because Google employees informed me that it is Google's stated intent that not only will there not be any option to turn off autocomplete in their browser, but that they outright wish to suppress any and all attempts to circumvent the feature, as they--and they have told me this directly--wish to force the feature on their users. I hope I will not receive the same attitude from Mozilla on this subject. Autocomplete is not just a minor feature, it is a major problem for my browsing and it is imperative that I have a way to turn it off. Not having a way to turn it off is a deal-breaker for me. I will quit Firefox and find another browser if I cannot turn off autocomplete.

Hit it again and the next one starting with B is highlighted. After the last one, loop back to the first one.
</p><p>That no longer works. Hitting B now stops on ""Bookmark This Page"", and depending on the time between key hits, it will also stop on ""Bookmark All Tabs..."". It will not go to any other lines on the menu. Now, to get to ""Bank"", I hit C followed by up arrow.
</p><p>Also, behavior is erratic in that sometimes it will stop on a line that does not match the key being hit.

1239000,1541053153,"How to selectively block ANY slide-in, pop-in, or other nuisance that comes on screen, by choice, without causing items such as video not to run","<p>There is a new kind of pop up nuisance.  The slide or fade in.  Some are set to mouse movement, others are timed.  Need to be able to selectively block these - my choice of which - without sites becoming useless.
</p><p>Tried NoScript but too complex and there is no succinct documentation from the producer.
Tried AdBlocker but it does not work on most of these kinds of popups and the company is not about working with users to block these from many sites, suggesting the sites have paid AdBlock not to block their trash.
Looked at other ""solutions"" but many are expensive and don't promise specifically to block these kinds of nuisances.
</p><p>One of the main sites with these nuisances is CNN.  Their pop-ins keep coming back even when you X them off.  Some are on EVERY page, like the cookie agreement, while others are timed and block your reading altogether.  You can't move your mouse in certain places on the page without something sliding in or popping up.  There are pop-ins when one reaches the end of a page, gets near the edges.  They are ALL intrusive!  What this does is turn one off to what the ad is there to push.  Lot of people have long been fed up with nags after the refusal to follow an ad.  When a user says no, that needs to be it.  There should be no further question.
</p><p>Too many sites use this nuisance advertising, many of them because there is little to no way to block them.  The internet is built on forced advertising.  This needs to stop.  If a product is worth its salt, it will sell without being pushed in a customer's face.  If a customer says NO once, that should be enough.  No site should be able to block access because of a user refusing to submit to some ad.

1239001,1541053222,Firefox randomly not downloading pictures,"<p>I asked this question a few days ago. My initial question can be found here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1238266"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1238266</a>
</p><p>""Since the most recent update I am experiencing problems in being able to save pictures. I find an image in Google Image Search, click on it and go to save .... however it does not save. The process even prompts me to select the folder I want it saved in, the name I want to give the file and so on. I do all of these things - but there is no picture there when I go to the folder. I have tried saving to different folders but no luck. This does not happen in all cases, only on some pictures.
</p><p>I find the only way i can save the picture is to click on View Image and then prompt it to save. However as my work involves finding lots of images online, this is adding several steps to the process. It is also annoying when I have to save 50+ pictures and then go back and find that maybe half-a-dozen or so are not there""
</p><p>A very helpful respondent suggested that the problem was being caused by a plugin. This was found and disabled. The problem has improved but still exists. Whereas before maybe 40% of the pictures I try to download are not downloading to the folder I indicate, it is down to maybe 20%. I can select the folder where the picture is to be saved, give it a new name and click save ... but nothing appears. In some cases, the picture is saving to the download folder.
</p><p>Before one says that it is plugins and add-ons that are the problem, I strongly doubt this. The sole add-on that my browser has at the moment is Shockwave Flash. I would really appreciate some help with this as at the moment my job is dependent on being able to collect pictures and slowing it down with having to go back and check every time whether a picture has downloaded or not is losing me money. Please help otherwise I will in desperation have to turn to another browser that doesn't have this issue.

I now run FF 63.0.1 (64 bit) and have noticed that my browsing history is lost after computer crashes. The session with open tabs and the correct urls are recreated, but not the browsing history (i.e. for example, links in a web forum appear ""unvisited"" rather than ""visited"" which is very unpractical, and the main history menu is empty. However not the ""recently closed tabs"" for some reason.) 
This was never a problem with earlier versions of FF. 
</p><p>Yes - I should have all the correct settings set in the history section in Settings/Options, by the way (I run the Swedish language version, am unsure what it's called).
</p><p>(I can't be entirely sure it's related to the FF 63 rather than something else, but it seems likely.)

</p><p>On another user account on the same PC, LastPass will work within Firefox and will login correctly. This doesn't happen with the problematic user account.

However, these icons don't show up anymore at all since the last update. I tried refreshing the tabs several times, even closing them and opening them again, yet to no avail. This makes it difficult to know which one of the images you have opened is the one you need, as all tabs only show the title of the image, not what image is on it. I'd just like to know if this is a bug, if that feature was simply removed, or if there's some setting that I can enable to make them show up again.

What I never, ever, ever had is a problem because I didn't update the software the instant an update became available.
</p><p>And a final note. ""There is a way to prevent this but were not allowed to mention it "" is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen on a support forum, and I've seen a lot of bad support forums. Please, please, please, Mozilla, start respecting your users again while you still have them.

1239274,1541271394,Tabs keep turning into a about:blank tab.,"<p>This doesn't happen very often but when it does it's annoying.
First of all here are my details: Firefox on desktop version 63.0.1.
This problem happens once in a while with no clear pattern and without clear consequences in the following uses of the browse, so it's random.
</p><p>The problem ensues as follows: 
I use the browser as i always do and suddenly as i am changing the contents of a tab it will stop for a brief moment then switch to a tab with the url ""about:blank"", completely blank.
From then on it is impossible to get that tab to work, whatever i try to do (except close it) will go to ""about:blank"".
The other tabs work fine during this ""process"" however if i switch to any of them the tab will become a ""about:blank"" tab instantly without any action from my part.
When all my tabs are converted i  finally give up and close the browser, then open it up again. Firefox starts fine but the session that would be restored is just filled with empty tabs. From then on i can browse as well as ever. 
Another detail, if i close the browser immediately as this error starts, that being without ""contaminating"" my other tabs, the session will restore well except for that patient zero.
</p><p>This doesn't affect my daily life and isn't that big of a deal but i would like to get it fixed.
Thanks, cheers.

1239308,1541308427,"firefox on one linux user account constantly uses 100% cpu, on other account works as should","<p>I have Firefox 63.0.1 and beginning with 63 I started noticing high cpu usage coming from Firefox, that for certain sites, e.g., Facebook, Messenger, Wunderground (all which were very slow before). Eventually it was using 100% cpu for all sites, so much so none would load, very frustrating. I use Kali Linux and its one account is root, and this is the account where this was happening. I even tried Firefox ESR, which is 60 and same problem. So, I created another user so I could use Chromium to look for a fix. Then I tried the exact same Firefox application on this new account, works better than ever. I am perplexed as to why this situation would be and how to fix it. All I can think of is there is some process running behind the scenes that is conflicting with some process on the root account, but wouldn't know where to begin to look. My version of 63 is an updated 60, if that helps any. This si so bad that when I try to use Firefox it stops everything else from working because it is using all the resources. I also noticed that memory usage has gone way up, to where Firefox and its processes use almost 100% of memory, this occurs over time whether I am using sites or it is just sitting. The same happens in safe mode, so it doesn't appear to be extensions, although my system monitor says web extensions in both safe mode and regular mode.

I had seen the message to ""Restart Firefox to Update"" for several days but was busy doing 'stuff' so I held off. Was also getting messages that Adobe Acrobat Reader had been updated successfully and that I should restart for the update to take effect. Finally, since I wanted to replace my AVG Free AV with ZoneAlarm Internet Security, I decided it was time to close all my active programs, including Firefox, remove AVG Free AV, download and install ZoneAlarm Internet Security and then shut down my laptop in order to install any Windows 7 updates. In order to shut down Firefox while maintaining all my Windows and Tabs, I typically just pull-down the Menu and select 'Exit'. When I open Firefox again, I select 'Restore previous session"", my Windows all come up and my tabs are all there and I'm off to the races! However, when I tried that this time, I received a warning that I had 8 Windows open and 441??? tabs (I have a lot  but it is nowhere near that number [150 maybe]) in use and they would all be closed if I chose to exit. Since this is my way of remembering all of the things that I am working on at any given time, I DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT!! So, the only choice I had seemed to be to click on the ""Restart Firefox to Update"" button in the ""Help"" --&gt; ""About Firefox"" dialog box. However, I did that about 6 hours ago and the little blue 'circle' just keeps 'spinning' and the hard drive access light flashes periodically (more so, within the first 30 minutes or so after clicking on the 'Restart' button) but the 'Restart' has not completed. I guess I will have to abort the update somehow but I don't want to do that part way through a 'Restart' and I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY OPEN TABS!!! What should I do to be able to get back to productive work using Firefox?!

1239392,1541403135,Request to add an option to disable Windows 10 theme/enable Windows 7 theme to allow glass support (using Aero Glass program),"<p>Hello there,
</p><p>For the benefit of Windows 10 users who have installed and enabled glass support via Aero Glass (<a href=""http://glass8.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">glass8.eu</a>), is it possible to add a toggle (perhaps in about:config) to allow disabling the default blue theme (specific in Windows 10) and enable a theme that supports glass (like Windows 7) so the title bar can be rendered with glass?
</p><p>For example: Chrome users report that disabling the custom title bar, via chrome://flags/#windows10-custom-titlebar, enables glass support to function beautifully.
</p><p>In the case of Firefox, there are two methods I've found to accomplish the desired effect but both come with caveats.....
</p><p>The first is utilizing a userChrome.css script which does the job but creates overlay issues with the minimize, maximize and close buttons. 
</p><p>The second involves editing the firefox .exe and removing the windows 10 ID entry. This displays all elements, including aeroglass, perfectly but breaks compatibility with sites that cross-check the agent ID in Firefox and OS (i.e Netflix).
</p><p>As long as a toggle can be used to load the Windows 7 theme (with glass support enabled, of course), or whichever method is deemed the best for this use case, then this would make the life of Windows 10 &amp; Aero Glass users much easier.
</p><p>Assuming that accomplishing this isn't a monumental task (and could also be extended to Thunderbird), that would be awesome!

If I wished to open Firefox I could always easily find it on my Dock because the Dock icon for FF has always been the regular red fox in a circle. 
Then today I went to open Firefox and I couldn't find it on my Dock. 
After careful observation using the magnifier I discovered that the Firefox program is still there, but its icon has been replaced by a totally insignificant looking icon that looks like a white notebook, with a small ruler, pencil and pen on top.
- What gives?
- Is this the ""new"" icon for FF?
- I don't like it. It's harder to find.
- I didn't ask for the change, nor did I do anything (as far as I know) to prompt it to happen.

1239543,1541518144,"On Mojave, Firefox will often stop responding after I come back and unlock my Mac.  How can I fix this?","<p>This one is hard to pin down, but occasionally Firefox will go unresponsive but will accept one previous mouse action (like clicking a tab) when I put Firefox in the background by clicking another open non-Firefox window and bringing it to the front.
</p><p>How this happens:
</p><p>1.  I lock my macbook and step away from the desk for an undetermined amount of time.
2.  I come back to my desk and unlock my computer.
3.  I click on firefox to browse for something and it doesn't respond
4.  I'll click another tab that isn't in focus, nothing will happen
5.  I click on any other open application and I will notice that Firefox will change to the tab I had just clicked on
6.  If I go back to Firefox, it will not respond to anything until I bring some other application to focus.
</p><p>Sometimes, if I wait a long time like 10 or 15 minutes, the problem will resolve itself.
Usually I just get frustrated and close  Firefox.
</p><p>I feel like this has to be a problem between Firefox and some other application that I run.  Some other appications that are typically open are:
</p><p>iTerm2
Spotify
Lastpass Plugin
Microsoft Outlook
<a href=""http://Atom.io"" rel=""nofollow"">Atom.io</a>
Sometimes TweetDeck
Maybe another Firefox profile
</p><p>I have been unable to regularly reproduce this issue, but it will typically happen multiple times a day.

New issue (i.e. behavior not seen previously).
</p><p>Currently, all attempts to download an image, from a site deemed to be ""Not secure"" due to having mixed content (images) fail.
- Instead of downloading, a small yellow circle appears over the Down-arrow (downloads) icon.
- Clicking on it shows ""Failed"" for every such image download attempt.
- Clicking Retry for each such image causes the download to succeed (in every case).
- So, yes.  There's a work-around.  But it's quite annoying when trying to download lots of images.
</p><p>Note: I followed the 'Learn more' link associated with the security status (orange triangle) and read the article:
-  It says ""A grey lock with an orange triangle indicates that Firefox is not blocking insecure passive content, such as images"".
-  But that's not the case.
-  It also says how to ""Unblock mixed content"".  But the method described there isn't available.
-  i.e. there is no ""Disable protection for now"" button (as described).

Editing some json file is a ridiculous suggestion.

Note: bookmarking chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.xul is handy, but doesn't solve the other problems.
</li><li> The built-in editor does not allow editing the website URL or duplicating a login.
</li><li> All of this make it impossible to use the built-in password editor to save things like PINs or answers to secret questions, all of which was very easy with the Saved Password Editor extension.
</li></ul>
<p>So will Firefox ever enable the Saved Password Editor to work again? The add-on page says that the extension needs a WebExtensions API. Will Firefox ever have one of those again? If the functionality was added into the build-in password manager, that would be good, too. Thank you.

1239867,1541720996,Can't load websites in Firefox Quantum in RDP session,"<p>Hello,
I look after our Citrix VDI environment.  We have an older version of Firefox (49.0.2) currently running on our shared servers so need to update this.  In test I have updated to the 64-bit version of Firefox Quantum 63.0.1
I am able to load pages and about:config when logged on to the server through VMware console session but as soon as I RDP to the server I get a blank page and websites wont load.  Nothing happens when I go to about:config.
This is happening when I am logged on via RDP with the same account as I use when logged on to the VMware console to the same server -  which is a Domain admin account.
I've turned off hardware acceleration, confirmed no DNS issue as I can browse in other browsers, no Windows Firewall turned on and No AV that could be blocking this
So not sure what else to check.  Is there a setting in about:config that I might need to change?

</p><p>For instance if I have a video link ""http...something.../myvideo.mp4"" and I click on it the video opens directly on the browser window without letting giving me an option do download it instead. I know that the ""typical"" way to do this is to right click and choose ""Save Link As..."" but sometimes this is not feasible or an actual link to click is not directly available.
</p><p>I know that for PDF files there's a way to fix this in the Firefox options by choosing to download or ask instead but for files such as .mp3, .mpg, .avi, etc. I don't know how this can be done.
</p><p>More and more websites / store fronts such as <a href=""http://humblebundle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">humblebundle.com</a> or <a href=""http://gog.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gog.com</a> that offer direct links to media files for download and although normally it's easy to right click on a link to use the option ""Save Link As..."" sometimes a link is not directly available, or the link may be copied or sent to the browser from a different program.
</p><p>There are of course workarounds to prevent these file types from opening directly in the browser window but I wish there was a less crude way of achieving this or that an external ""Download Manager"" wasn't necessary to get regular download links anymore.

1240242,1542041202,Restoring .json bookmarks backup deletes current bookmarks but doesn't import saved ones,"<p>Dear experts,
</p><p>I'm trying to restore a .json bookmarks backup produced on a 60.0 firefox installation. When trying to restore it, I select the file, confirm the replace dialog and press OK. All the existing bookmarks are deleted but no bookmarks are imported. No error message is issued and no bookmarks are imported. No Firefox activity can be seen (no CPU consumption, no network or disk I/O, no increase in RAM used by Firefox). I have even waited 24h just in case, but still does nothing. I do *NOT* receive an ""Unable to process backup file message.

</p><p>I'm trying to restore in a laptop running Windows 10 and for the time being, I have no access to any other computer with a different Operating System.
</p><p>I have tried different Firefox releases including the latest and the 60.3.0esr both 32 and 64 bits editions.
</p><p>The disk of the PC where the Firefox which produced the backup is broken, so restoring the places.sqlite file or producing another backup or a bookmark export is not an option.
</p><p>Do you know how can I get this backup restored?
</p><p>Your help will be greatly appreciated.
</p><p>Thanks in advance.
